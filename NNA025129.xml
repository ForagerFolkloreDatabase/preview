                <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

            <samplingDecl>
                <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly (or via the proxy of an interpreter or other immediate intermediary)
                    from an informant who either lived or grew up as a member of a culture whose
                    primary subsistence at the time of recording was or until recently had been
                    hunting, gathering, and/or fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the
                    recording and the relative freedom from external cultural influences. To create
                    a corpus with high representability, multiple versions of the same narrative
                    were omitted, cultural clusters and close cultural relations between two groups
                    were negatively taken into account, and it was aimed for the highest degree of
                    diversity.</p>

<p>Some <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> lived in a sweat-house near where <animal>Bluejay</animal> and <animal>Lizard</animal> lived. These latter had all kinds of food stored in bags of tule. The <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> had only <plant>acorns</plant>, and used to have to go to the other house to get <animal>salmon</animal> and meat. A <animal>Grizzly-Bear</animal> went over at sundown and sat down, saying, "I was sent over for scraps;" then <animal>Bluejay</animal> would say, "All right, get out some <animal>salmon</animal>," and <animal>Lizard</animal> would give <animal>Grizzly-Bear</animal> a large pile of it. When he got back home, the others would say, "They always give us a lot." In the morning another <animal>Grizzly</animal> went, and came back with a huge basket of <plant>pine</plant>-nuts; and in the evening then another would go, to get a lot of <plant>sunflower</plant>-seeds. In this way <animal>Bluejay</animal> and <animal>Lizard</animal> gave away all the food they had, and began to get hungry. <animal>Lizard</animal>, however, had been afraid that this would happen, so he had hidden ten <animal>salmon</animal> under his pillow while <animal>Bluejay</animal> had gone after wood one day. When all the rest of the food was gone, <animal>Lizard</animal> produced this reserve supply, and the two lived on this for a time. The <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> had saved much of the food they had begged, and feasted while the others were starving. The <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> hoped the others would die.</p>
<p><animal>Bluejay</animal> soon got very weak, but <animal>Lizard</animal> was still able to get about. One day <animal>Lizard</animal> covered up the coals with ashes in their house, closed the smoke-hole, and, taking his knife, crept over to the house where the <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> were, all asleep. <animal>Lizard</animal> looked in and saw all the food they had there in storage. Then he went into the house, picked out the <pb n="169"/>largest <animal>Grizzly-Bear</animal>, crawled into his anus, and cut out his heart. He brought the heart out, then skinned the body of the <animal>bear</animal>, the others meanwhile sleeping on. <animal>Lizard</animal> baked the liver quickly in the ashes, and ate it, then, leaning a pole up against the door, he walked on this, so that the <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> could not see his tracks. He took all the <animal>Grizzly-Bear</animal> meat home with him, and one basket of <plant>acorns</plant>. He found <animal>Bluejay</animal> almost dead; but he cooked some meat, and gave him some, and, after getting a little stronger, he was able to eat a great deal; and the two ate nearly all night.</p>
<p>In the morning the <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> woke up, and missed one of their number, but thought he had merely gone out of the house for a time. So they were not worried, but built a fire and sweated. <animal>Lizard</animal> and <animal>Bluejay</animal> kept quiet in their house, and did not move out. Every night <animal>Lizard</animal> did the same thing, killing one of the <animal>Bears</animal> until he had killed four of them, - two on each side of the door as they slept. The <animal>Grizzly-Bears</animal> did not suspect what the trouble was, for they thought both <animal>Lizard</animal> and <animal>Bluejay</animal> were dead. Thus <animal>Lizard</animal> and <animal>Bluejay</animal> lived through the winter.</p>
