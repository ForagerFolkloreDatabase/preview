        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p><rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs> the moon looked down at the earth one night, when his light was shining quite <rs type="color">brightly</rs>, to see if any one was moving. When the earth people were all asleep was the time he chose for playing with his three <rs type="animal">dogs</rs>. He called them <rs type="animal">dogs</rs>, but the earth people called them <rs type="animal">snakes</rs>, the <rs type="animal">death adder</rs>, the <rs type="animal"><rs type="color">black</rs> snake</rs>, and the <rs type="animal">tiger snake</rs>. As he looked down on to the earth, with his three <rs type="animal">dogs</rs> beside him, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs> saw about a dozen <rs ref="g:GIP0247.040">daens</rs>, or <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows, crossing a creek. He called to them saying, "Stop, I want you to carry my <rs type="animal">dogs</rs> across that creek." But the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows, though they liked <rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs> well, did not like his <rs type="animal">dogs</rs>, for sometimes when he had brought these <rs type="animal">dogs</rs> to play on the earth, they had bitten not only the earth <rs type="animal">dogs</rs> but their masters; and the poison left by the bites had killed those bitten. So the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows said, "No, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs>, we are too frightened; your <rs type="animal">dogs</rs> might bite us. They are not like our <rs type="animal">dogs</rs>, whose bite would not kill us."</p>
      <p><rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs> said, "If you do what I ask you, when you die you shall come to life again, not die and stay always where you are put when you are dead. See this piece of bark. <pb n="9"/>I throw it into the water." And he threw a piece of bark into the creek. "See it comes to the top again and floats. That is what would happen to you if you would do what I ask you: first under when you die, then up again at once. If you will not take my <rs type="animal">dogs</rs> over, you foolish <rs ref="g:GIP0247.040">daens</rs>, you will die like this," and he threw a stone into the creek, which sank to the bottom. "You will be like that stone, never rise again, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.130">Wombah</rs> <rs ref="g:GIP0247.040">daens</rs>!"</p>
      <p>But the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows said, "We cannot do it, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs>. We are too frightened of your <rs type="animal">dogs</rs>."</p>
      <p>"I will come down and carry them over myself to show you that they are quite safe and harmless." And down he came, the <rs type="animal"><rs type="color">black</rs> snake</rs> coiled round one arm, the <rs type="animal">tiger snake</rs> round the other, and the <rs type="animal">death adder</rs> on his shoulder, coiled towards his neck. He carried them over. When he had crossed the creek he picked up a big stone, and he threw it into the water, saying, "Now, you cowardly <rs ref="g:GIP0247.040">daens</rs>, you would not do what I, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs>, asked you to do, and so forever you have lost the chance of rising again after you die. You will just stay where you are put, like that stone does under the water, and grow, as it does, to be part of the earth. If you had done what I asked you, you could have died as often as I die, and have come to life as often as I come to life. But now you will only be <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows while you live, and bones when you are dead."</p>
      <p><rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs> looked so cross, and the three <rs type="animal">snakes</rs> hissed so fiercely, that the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows were very glad to see them disappear from their sight behind the <rs type="plant">trees</rs>. The <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows had always been frightened of <rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs>'s <rs type="animal">dogs</rs>, and now they hated them, and they said, "If we could get <pb n="10"/>them away from <rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs> we would kill them." And thenceforth, whenever they saw a <rs type="animal">snake</rs> alone they killed it. But <rs ref="g:GIP0247.001">Bahloo</rs> only sent more, for he said, "As long as there are <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows there shall be <rs type="animal">snakes</rs> to remind them that they would not do what I asked them."</p>
