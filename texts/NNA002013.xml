        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>This story happened almost at the beginning of the world. The <rs type="animal" key="Musca domestica" ref="q:Q166111">fly</rs>, by rubbing his front legs together, makes fire by friction-making-motions just like a person. Thus when the <rs type="animal">fly</rs> is with an animal carcass and makes fire by <pb n="365"/>friction and makes smoke signals, the <rs type="animal">bird</rs> flying along finds the carcass on the desert. That is why it happens like that. Even today when any carcass is out of sight on the desert, the <rs type="animal">bird</rs>, due to the <rs type="animal">fly</rs> making fire by friction and making smoke signals, as it were, finds it and finally gets to it. That is how it happens.</p>
