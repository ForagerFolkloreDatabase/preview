        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>Long, long ago rich <persName>Anoogne</persName> lived in the village on <placeName>Hinchinbrook island</placeName>, keeping rough storehouses with their stone shelves <pb n="123"/>filled with valuable furs, many clothes and all kinds of native foods. He preserved many <rs type="animal">fish</rs> and eggs in the ground, for sour <rs type="animal">fish</rs> dug from the earth formed his favorite repast.</p>
      <p>All of the villages about worked for the <persName>Anoogne</persName> and often he gave feasts in his house and the guests praised him highly for his generous deeds.</p>
      <p>One evening the <persName>Anoogne</persName> took a walk on the seashore. The sky was <rs type="color">blue</rs>, the sea was calm and the old man enjoyed his slow promenade. Suddenly his foot slipped and he fell. He had stepped on a dead <rs type="animal">fish</rs> cast on the beach.</p>
      <p><persName>Anoogne</persName> started to complain bitterly, but a voice came from on high, saying: "Do not scold. Do not curse the old <rs type="animal">fish</rs>. If I did not give to you the same <rs type="animal">fish</rs> for your food you will starve."</p>
      <p>"If you did not send this <rs type="animal">fish</rs>, I will not starve," the <persName>Anoogne</persName> replied.</p>
      <p>"Why not?" the voice asked.</p>
      <p>The old man told him, "I have all kinds of <rs type="animal">fish</rs>. I have all kinds of meat, enough to keep me forever. My stores are filled with <rs type="animal">halibut</rs>, <rs type="animal">seal</rs>, <rs type="animal">bear</rs>, <rs type="animal">salmon</rs>, <rs type="animal">codfish</rs>, and <rs type="animal">mountain goats</rs>. I shall not lose the food I have stored."</p>
      <p>But the voice continued, "Remember, <persName>Anoogne</persName>, very soon you shall be the most miserable man and thy riches shall not be of use to thyself."</p>
      <p>"Never, never," replied the excited <persName>Anoogne</persName>. "I am the wealthiest of the natives and I shall never grow poor."</p>
      <p>"What will you eat if your food freezes over?" he was asked.</p>
      <p>"I have dried <rs type="animal">fish</rs> and meat and have buried <rs type="animal">fish</rs> eggs, a reserve that will last a long time."</p>
      <p>"I can send the deep snow to cover the earth," he was told.</p>
      <p>"Do not think you can even cover the <rs type="plant">koongat</rs>, the edible <rs type="plant">trees</rs>?" the haughty <persName>Anoogne</persName> responded.</p>
      <p>No reply came, only repeated in gradually dying echoes, the sound of the word "ahtat."</p>
      <p>Then the big flakes of snow started to fall softly over the earth. When the <persName>Anoogne</persName> approached his house the snow was up to his knees. His food had frozen and become like paper. The old man and his helpers started to shovel the <rs type="color">white</rs> blanket, <pb n="124"/>but such great flakes fell this work soon appeared useless. The snow even passed through the roof and filled the barabaras.</p>
      <p>Again came the voice from on high, "There you have it."</p>
      <p>All of the island was covered by deep snow for twenty-four months. All living <rs type="animal">creatures</rs> perished. There was no food on land, there were no <rs type="animal">fish</rs> in the sea.</p>
      <p><persName>Anoogne</persName> began to starve. Greatly did he regret his mistake and his conceit. He called his neighbors and confessed his sin.</p>
      <p>Then the voice came again, saying, "Do not speak bad words. Do not curse the food I send you. Do not grumble against fate."</p>
      <p>So ended the story of the richest old man of the ancient village of <placeName>Nutchek</placeName>.</p>
