        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>A long time ago <persName>Tohan</persName> had a knife. He forgot it in the jungle and did not return to look for it. The knife cried bitterly. A passing <rs type="animal">tiger</rs> heard the crying and went up to the knife. "Why are you crying?" he asked. "<persName>Tohan</persName> has forgotten all about me," replied the knife, "you go and bite him." In those days <rs type="animal">tigers</rs> did not know about biting people. "No, I don't know how", said the <rs type="animal">tiger</rs>. "You bite him here," said the knife pointing to the <rs type="animal">tiger</rs>'s throat. So the <rs type="animal">tiger</rs> went to <persName>Tohan</persName> and bit him in the throat. <persName>Tohan</persName> died. <shift feature="epimyth"/>Since that time <rs type="animal">tigers</rs> have been biting humans.<note>This legend provides a reason for why <rs type="animal">tigers</rs> prey on humans which differs from the previous legend. Although it is not stated that the above is an example of <rs ref="g:GEE2143.030">punén</rs>, it is likely that this myth is related to one kind of <rs ref="g:GEE2143.030">punén</rs>, namely that if one has lost one's knife in the jungle it is <rs ref="g:GEE2143.030">punén</rs> not to go in search of it. Transgression of this kind of <rs ref="g:GEE2143.030">punén</rs> leads to attack by a <rs type="animal">tiger</rs>. (See Part IV).</note></p>
