        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p><animal>Fish-Hawk</animal> lived down at <placeName>Pit River</placeName>. When Sun travelled in winter, he left his daughter at home, but he carried her about with him in summer. Sun did not want his daughter to marry any poor person, but a great man, like <animal>Pine-Marten</animal>, <animal>Wolf</animal>, or <animal>Coyote</animal>. <animal>Fish-Hawk</animal> got angry at Sun because he talked in this way of poor people, so he started and went down to the ocean, to Sun's place, and slipped into the sweat-house. It was winter now, and Sun's daughter was put away inside the house in a basket. <animal>Fish-Hawk</animal> stole her, carried her on his back to <animal>Coyote</animal>'s house, and hid her away. He made the journey in one night.</p>
      <p>Next morning Sun could not find his daughter, and did not know where she had gone. That morning <animal>Fish-Hawk</animal> took the basket with the woman in it, and put it away under the rocks in muddy water, to hide it so that Sun could not see and could not find his daughter.</p>
      <p>Sun searched everywhere in the air and on the ground, but could not find her. Then he hired all men who were good divers or swimmers to hunt in the water, for he thought she was hidden in the water. All searched until they came to <placeName>Pit River</placeName>. One would search part of the way, then another. <animal>Kingfisher</animal> was the last man to go in search of her. He went along slowly to look where the water was muddy. At last he thought he saw just a bit of something under the water. Then he went over the place carefully again and again.</p>
      <p>Many people were going along the river, watching these men looking for Sun's daughter. <animal>Kingfisher</animal> filled his pipe, smoked, and blew on the water to make it clear, for he was a great shaman. Then he went up in the air and came down over the place. The people were all excited, and thought surely he would find something. He came along slowly, and sat and smoked again, and blew the smoke over the water. Then he rose, rolled up his pipe and tobacco, and put them away. Then he took a long pole, stood over the water, pushed his pole down deep, and speared with it until he got hold of the basket and pulled it out. Old Sun came, untied the basket, took his daughter out, washed her, then put her back. He paid each of the men he had hired. Part of their pay was in shells.</p>
      <p><animal>Kingfisher</animal> said that it was <animal>Fish-Hawk</animal> who had hidden the basket. Sun put the basket on his back and started home. He was so happy to get his daughter back that he did no harm to <animal>Fish-Hawk</animal> for stealing her.</p>
