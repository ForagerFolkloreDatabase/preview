        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p><persName>Kukpi</persName> started. She came from somewhere [unknown northern place]. Her road [went by] open sea [past] here. Hence she went on, went on &#8230; to <placeName>Marai</placeName>. She sat down [rested, stayed] at a place there. She tried [tested] that place, <placeName>Marai</placeName>. No, it was not good. She poked-stirred [the ground], and water [was] there; that water [since, continuously] is there. She went on to <placeName>Lili</placeName>. She put a big water there. She rested there. She said: "this place is not good," so she left it. She stirred-poked, made a hole. That water is still there. She went on towards <placeName>Dapan</placeName>. "I shall try this place." She said: "this place <pb n="128"/>is not good." She left it. Water still [exists] there. Thence she left for the place called <placeName>Nimati</placeName>. There she rested. Water is still there: She [dug a hole] poking-stirring with a stick. She left that place [went towards] <placeName>Karinggawulkul</placeName>.<note>There is a suggestion in some accounts that after <placeName>Karinggawulkul</placeName> she "went round" (turned) towards Kimul, making waters and naming places as she went. That course would have taken her across <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>'s road. At one such place (<placeName>Yambanyi or Yambermin</placeName>) I found a rock-shelter with a vivid painting of a female figure alongside another painting with features in common with those of a painting of <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> a few miles away. The region is one where the territories of four tribes - Murinbata, Djamindjung, Nangiomeri and Wagaman - march together. It is at such places that a commutation between elements of myths seems most likely to have occurred.</note> She [did the same thing] poking-stirring with a stick. That water [exists] still there. She moved on to <placeName>Kanung</placeName>. There, she poked-stirred; water [came out]. She rested there. She said: "No, this place is too small, too cold." She left it and moved to <placeName>Ngaiyilu</placeName>. "I shall try this place" [tasting], the water. "No, not good." She stirred and the water came out. She moved to <placeName>Karinmem</placeName>. She put there the <plant>bamboo-grass</plant> that still exists. The water is still there. Then she went on, went on &#8230; She kept going a long way &#8230; she went, rested at <placeName>Nganangur</placeName>. She stirred with a stick; water came out; <plant>bamboo-grass</plant> is still there. She did not stop long. She went past that place, went on &#8230; and rested at <placeName>Purgala (Purgaiyala)</placeName>. She looked back over her shoulder. "Ah, that is the road on which I came." Resting there, she made a song. She sang that song!</p>
      <p>She sang: </p>
      <lg type="song">
        <l>Ah, <placeName>Purgala</placeName> wura nyenyi</l>
        <l>Lawa nyenyi, wura nyenyi &#8230; </l>
        <l>Lardpanga lardpanga</l>
        <l>Wa&#331;guwala karalak pindji pindji.</l>
      </lg>
      <p>[A second version of the song is:</p>
      <lg type="song">
        <l>Kara nyinyi binyi binyi</l>
        <l>Toitpaya&#331;ga toitpa&#331;ara</l>
        <l>Wa&#331;guwala wa&#331;guwala.</l>
      </lg>
      <p>Neither is in the Murinbata language. But everyone agrees that <persName>Kukpi</persName> was singing about her journey on the sea, and that she was "sorry" (thought with sad affection) about her journey.]</p>
      <p>"Ah, this place is good. It is warm. I shall stop there." She stayed-rested there [forever].</p>
      <p>[There is some obscurity about <persName>Kukpi</persName>'s movements after <placeName>Purgala</placeName>. One version holds that she turned aside, went along a small creek, made a large water-hole, and reached the hills at <placeName>Mariwan</placeName> after a journey in an anti-clockwise direction. At <placeName>Mariwan</placeName> she turned and retraced her steps to <placeName>Purgala</placeName>. Then she went on to the unnamed place of final rest. There is mention of two <pb n="129"/>intermediate places - <placeName>Kiningga</placeName> and <placeName>Ngananggi</placeName> - between <placeName>Purgala</placeName> and the final unnamed resting-place, at which she is said to have made a "nest" (diri). I should point out that the circular excavation in which the dancers throng at the rite of Punj is also sometimes described as a nest.]</p>
      <p>A true man [was] there [who] did not see-know. He said: "I shall go to catch a <animal>rock-wallaby</animal>." He took spear-thrower and spear and went hunting. A <animal>wallaby</animal> went jumping towards that place [where <persName>Kukpi</persName> was]. She saw it. She said: "Kidjirudup!" That sufficed! The <animal>wallaby</animal> fell down [dead] at once. That man was still running after it &#8230; ah! close now [to <persName>Kukpi</persName>]. She called out to him Yau! He [startled] said: "Who is that?" <persName>Kukpi</persName> said: "The <animal>wallaby</animal> is lying there!" The man said: "That is well."</p>
      <p><persName>Kukpi</persName> said: "You are very afraid; you should not be afraid."</p>
      <p><persName>Kukpi</persName> said: "You should sit down here where there is deep shade from the <plant>lakumin tree</plant>; you should make fire with fire-sticks." Slowly the man tracked the <animal>kangaroo</animal>, put it on his shoulder, carried it to a <plant>tree</plant>, left it there. <persName>Kukpi</persName> said: "There, close to me, there! You should sit down in the shade." He made fire with fire-sticks (minga). The fire came with one twirl of the sticks! He put the <animal>wallaby</animal> in the smoke to singe the hair. He cut open its belly. He waited; the fire was now all charcoal. He began to make a place in the charcoal to roast the <animal>wallaby</animal>. He offered some to <persName>Kukpi</persName>. "Do you want some of this flesh?" "No," she said. "You put it on your shoulder." The man said: "Where shall I go?" <persName>Kukpi</persName> said: "You should go straight to that place there, where there is a cleft; there is a clear place there." Carrying that <animal>wallaby</animal>, he went [where she had said]; he went &#8230; close to <placeName>Palarngga</placeName>, where you can look down [from a high place]. <persName>Kukpi</persName> said: "Kidjiridup!" That sufficed. He was no more. He fell down [that steep place] and was broken to pieces.</p>
      <p>The man had lost his way; he could not find the road he had come by. <persName>Kukpi</persName> said: "You should not go back on the same road; if you want to go back you should go that way," pointing towards the cleft. He carried the <animal>wallaby</animal> there, up a steep place. Looking down, he thought he saw the road. Then he could not see it any more. No road was there! He could not find a way down the steep place. <persName>Kukpi</persName> said: "Kigiritup!" At once that man fell down to the bottom dead.</p>
      <p>His people [in camp were] waiting-watching. They were talking [among themselves]. Yau! "What [unknown] thing did he see?" Another man went [to see, look]. He followed the track, followed the track &#8230; to that place. Yau! [<persName>Kukpi</persName> spoke]. "That man has gone back; I sent him back." [He spoke to himself.] "Who is [unknown] person here?" Then [seeing <persName>Kukpi</persName>]: "O, there is a person here, of a <color>yellow</color> colour." <persName>Kukpi</persName> said to him: "I saw him roasting [a <animal>wallaby</animal>] there, right there," pointing. "Yes," she said, "there. You track [him] from there, where the road [goes] to the cleft over at that place." He went, following the track, to where you can look down [from a <pb n="130"/>steep place]. <persName>Kukpi</persName> said again, "Kidjiridup!" He was no more. He fell down and was broken to pieces. She did [said] that thing to him at that same place.</p>
      <p>His people [were] watching-waiting fruitlessly. Another man got up to go. He followed that track &#8230; to that place. Yau! <persName>Kukpi</persName> said: "One man came to me." The man was frightened. He looked back-sideways [across his shoulder], thinking: who is this differently-coloured one? <persName>Kukpi</persName> said: "That is where he went, over there. Yes, there. Do you see? I sent him on that road over there. He went on that road. You go too." The man went on that same road. He looked down from that high place at <placeName>Palarngga</placeName>. "Kidjiridup!" <persName>Kukpi</persName> said it again. He was no more. He fell down and was broken to pieces.</p>
      <p>Those people [were] watching-waiting. [Now] they began to think-from-the-belly, differently. There was something strange-different yonder. What [unknown] thing had destroyed three men there? They said [to one man]: "You go [try to find out]." One old wise-man went. That man was <persName>Padurutj</persName>, the first wana&#331;gal (wise man). He was strong and big, bearded down to his chest. The north-west wind blew from that place. <persName>Kukpi</persName> was singing. The wise man heard her singing. Kong! Kong! Kong! Kong! The sound of the tapping sticks! She went on singing. <persName>Kukpi</persName> was singing Ningga Ningga [the "sweetheart" song]. <persName>Padurutj</persName> said: "Something is there, where those three were destroyed." He crept up, looked at <persName>Kukpi</persName>, and went back to camp. He told no one what he had seen. He was sick, and then got better. He went again to that place, by a different road, upwind. <persName>Kukpi</persName> was still singing. <persName>Padurutj</persName> listened. "Ah," he said, "that is the woman who destroyed those three." He went upwind to that place. "Ah," that wise man said [to himself], "what is this [unknown] thing?" He listened-learned that song, the Kurangara song from <persName>Kukpi</persName>. <persName>Kukpi</persName> sang: "Pingarala milpirin pa&#331;u waragadji mala." [We do not know that language.] He listened to that song. He understood it at once. <persName>Kukpi</persName> sang: "I am sitting here at <placeName>Purgala</placeName>." She sang in Murinyuwen: "Wa&#331;guwala kara ninyi binyibinyi toitpa&#331;gu." He got up now [went back]. He listened-learned &#8230; then he went back to the camp.</p>
      <p>He spoke to all the people. Yau! "She has destroyed-finished them, that unknown person who is there. There is a little island. It is a place where there are <plant>trees</plant>." That is what he said. Everyone wept. They were weeping.<note>I am reasonably satisfied that the core-story of the Murinbata myth ends at that point. But one may sometimes hear an extension which, in my opinion, is an accretion from the Djamindjung to the south. It fuses with the story of <persName>Kukpi</persName> an account of the origin of the bullroarer which, in the real Murinbata tradition, is attributed to <persName>Kudapun</persName>, The <animal>Apostle Bird</animal> ('On Aboriginal Religion. II. Sacramentalism, Rite and Myth,' Oceania, Vol. XXX, No. 4, footnote, p. 263). In the accretion, the fourth man to try to solve the mystery of the successive deaths of the hunters at <persName>Kukpi</persName>'s hands is identified as <persName>Padurutj</persName>, who is said to have been the first ki&#7769;man or wana&#331;gal (in that context implying both "wise man" and "warlock"). On the first visit he is said to have heard <persName>Kukpi</persName> singing both Karwadi and Dingiri songs. He knew that such songs belonged only to men, and not to women or children. On the second visit he recognised, on flat stones near where <persName>Kukpi</persName> was sitting, secret marks that are put only on bullroarers. <persName>Kukpi</persName>'s son was there, and he told <persName>Padurutj</persName> that the marks and songs were both Karwadi (in that context implying "sacred and secret"). He gave two stone bullroarers to <persName>Padurutj</persName>, who took them back to camp and showed them to other men, who then made bullroarers of wood. Two women now went to that place and picked up stone bullroarers. They took them back to camp and showed the men. By that time everyone knew what bullroarers were, and knew their significance. The men made a pretext of changing camp, and during the move killed the two women with stone-axes.</note></p>
