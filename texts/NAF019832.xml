        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>[The tale of the pygmy who sat down to watch a group of <rs type="animal">chimpanzees</rs> playing:] one of the <rs type="animal">chimpanzees</rs> noticed the pygmy and came over to him. He said, "What are you doing here?" and he called to his brother <rs type="animal">chimpanzees</rs>, "Come and see this pygmy." They came over and said, "We'll fight him." One of the <rs type="animal">chimpanzees</rs> grabbed at the pygmy, but meanwhile the pygmy had taken up his spear. The pygmy killed the <rs type="animal">chimpanzee</rs>. The others said, "What did the pygmy kill our brother with?" and one answered, "It seemed to be with the root of a <rs type="plant">tree</rs>." So another of the <rs type="animal">chimpanzees</rs> gathered up the roots of the <rs type="plant">trees</rs> and threw them at the pygmy. The pygmy killed him with his spear. The remaining <rs type="animal">chimpanzees</rs> sat down and tried to puzzle this out. One of them searched all round and found the spear. He took it and killed the pygmy. The <rs type="animal">chimpanzees</rs> then gathered some leaves and put them over the pygmy. They all left. The <pb n="54"/>brother went to look for him. He found him dead, covered with leaves. He said, "What could have happened? Who killed my brother?" <shift feature="epimyth"/>Basi [' That is all'].</p>
