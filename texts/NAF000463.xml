        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>In the beginning of things, man and the <animal>animals</animal> came out in this way, <apartmyth>at least so the Bechuanas say. At <placeName>Sechele's Town</placeName> there is a big hole called <placeName>L&#466;&#466;we</placeName>, which goes down a long, long way. It is so deep that if you take a stone and drop it down the hole, you can hear it falling for a great while, but you never hear it get to the bottom; so nobody knows how far it goes down, for we never try to get to the bottom, as we are very much afraid.</apartmyth> In this big hole the <animal>animals</animal> and the men were together at first. But the hole was far too small for them after a while, and they were constantly quarrelling for want of room, and each wanted to push the other out. At last they were so angry that the men began to drive the <animal>animals</animal> out, and the <animal>animals</animal> would not go, so the men had to drive them out backwards. As fast as they drove them out, they tried to come in again; but at last they quite drove them out. Now the ground at the mouth of the cave was very soft, there was a river, and some <plant>reeds</plant> growing there. The <animal>animals</animal>, especially the <animal>cattle</animal>, made much spoor, and the ground was much cut up with their tracks. The <animal>animals</animal> were very much afraid, and did not go very far from the mouth of the cave. They stayed round about the hole the first night. By and by, however, they all wandered away, and began to eat the <plant>grass</plant> round about the place, and so they forgot all about the hole. After a time the men began to be so many that there was no room for them, and so they began to quarrel, and so they drove each other out; and when they were going, they <pb n="80"/>destroyed the spoor of the <animal>animals</animal>, <epimyth>so that you cannot see the spoor any more. If you go to the cave at <placeName>L&#466;&#466;we</placeName> you will see that what I tell you is true, and it is the end of the tale.</epimyth></p>
