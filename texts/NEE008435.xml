        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>Erstwhile there was no land, but only water everywhere. In the heavens, <persName>Num</persName> [a heavenly spirit] was living, and many kinds of <rs type="animal">birds</rs>. <persName>Num</persName> sent <rs type="animal">swans</rs> and <rs type="animal">geese</rs> to see if there was land somewhere. They returned saying that they had not seen land anywhere. <persName>Num</persName> sent out the <rs type="animal" key="Gavia arctica">black-throated loon (Gavia arctica)</rs> and said, "You are skilled in diving, go check if there is land or anything else beneath the water." The <rs type="animal">loon</rs> went out and dove straight down. On the sixth day it came back to the heavens and said, "There was something to be seen below, but my strength failed me. If there was someone with more strength than me, they surely could reach the place." The <rs type="animal">ljuuri bird</rs> said, "If that is the case, then I will go." It dove under and returned on the seventh day with some soil or a blade of <rs type="plant">grass</rs> in its beak and made a nest which drifted on the water, back and forth, depending on the wind. As <rs type="animal">Ljuuri</rs> did not return to report, <persName>Num</persName> decided to come down himself to investigate. There he drifted about with the wind on the water. <persName>Num</persName> spoke, "Let us prepare a larger earth, dive down once more!" <rs type="animal">Ljuuri</rs> went and stayed away for seven days on his journey, <pb n="4"/>and <persName>Num</persName> packed the land together. When the land had gotten big enough to build a dwelling on it, <persName>Num</persName> said, "Now we will observe the night's rest, now we can lay us down to rest." An old man came to them from somewhere and said, "I have looked everywhere for a dwelling place for myself and have not found one anywhere. Take me in!" <persName>Num</persName> said, "We have prepared this land for ourselves. Go and search yourself, perhaps you will find land. We don't let you in." But the old man begged and begged, and finally <persName>Num</persName> took him in for the night. When they arose at dawn, the old man was not inside. He was outside and was washing his face at the edge of the land, but actually he was not really washing his face, but was trying to break the land apart. <persName>Num</persName> said, "What are you doing there, you have already broken off half of the land!" He said, "I am washing myself." <persName>Num</persName> said, "Go away!" The old man went away. They enlarged the land. <persName>Num</persName> bade the people to come, <rs type="animal">Samoyeds</rs>, Ostyaks, Russians, <rs type="animal">animals</rs>, <rs type="plant">trees</rs>, rivers, and so on. The old man from before came again and asked <persName>Num</persName> for land to live on. <persName>Num</persName> spoke, "We have made this land ourselves. Had you helped, then we would let you on it, we do not need you now." The old man begged and begged, pushed his staff onto the land and said, "If you just give me the spot where my staff is, then I will not need anything else." <persName>Num</persName> thought, "It is not a big space, there where the staff is," and said, "Well, alright, you can live there!" The old man went into the hole and sneered, "I tricked you after all! I live here on my spot under the earth and will steal away the people." <persName>Num</persName> spoke, "I <pb n="5"/>thought wrong. I thought he would live on the earth, but the monster went into the ground."</p>
