        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>When <rs type="animal">Silver-Fox</rs> left this world, he said to his sweat-house, "Nobody shall ever come in here," and he left a strong wind there to guard the place. No one dares go near this place, for a whirlwind blows up out of it, makes a noise like thunder, and only shamans can go near; but whoever enters is immediately turned to stone inside. <rs type="animal">Wolf</rs> and <rs type="animal">Silver-Fox</rs> left their power of wind there. <shift feature="apartmyth"/>Even now, <rs type="animal">wolves</rs> will catch people that come near; and whoever gets inside, turns to <rs type="color">white</rs> rock.</p>
      <p><shift feature="diegesis"/><pb n="287"/>Once a great shaman dreamed of a <rs type="animal">wolf</rs> that was in that sweathouse. He went in. As soon as he got inside, the wind stopped. He went around inside and vomited blood. He said it was an immense sweathouse, as much as a mile across inside. When he came out, he fell down nearly dead. Another shaman cured him. He had seen nothing inside but men turned to stone. Next night this shaman's hair turned as <rs type="color">white</rs> as snow.</p>
