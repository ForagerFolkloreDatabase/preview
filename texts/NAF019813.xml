        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>There was once a poor pygmy girl. She was crippled, and her skin was full of disease. She was only about eight years old. The pygmies were breaking camp, and nobody was willing to carry the little cripple for fear of catching the disease. So when all the pygmies had left the camp the little girl was all alone, by herself. She cried and she cried and she cried. And when night fell she crawled into her empty hut and she cried herself to sleep. At daybreak she heard a sound like 'pip! pip! pip!' It was the <rs type="animal">bird</rs> called the <rs type="animal">fifi bird</rs>. It had fastened a long <rs type="plant">rattan vine</rs> between two <rs type="plant">trees</rs>, and it was sitting on the <rs type="plant">vine</rs> swinging back and forth, back and forth. The little girl went to look more closely, and the <rs type="animal">bird</rs> flew away. In the distance there was a MuBira with his hunting trap. Seeing the diseased cripple he came up and said, "My poor child, you have been left here all by yourself. I must kill you." And he took his knife and lifted it to kill the girl. But the knife caught his nose and cut it, and it killed him and he fell down dead. The girl caught hold of the <rs type="plant">rattan vine</rs>, and she swung herself back and forth, back and forth. As she was swinging on the <rs type="plant">vine</rs>, another MuBira, seeing the movement, came slowly into the clearing. "What is this?" he said to himself. "Why, it is a crippled little pygmy girl. Get off your <rs type="plant">vine</rs> swing, my child, and come over here to me." The girl got down from her swing and made her way over to where the MuBira was standing. Then she sat down on the ground and held her withered little legs. "Come nearer, my child," said the MuBira, reaching forward. "No, No! I can't come any nearer," cried the girl, "my legs hurt so much, and I am all diseased." "Very well, I shall kill you," replied the MuBira. "Oh please don't do that, I'm only a poor deserted child." "But why did your father leave you all alone?" asked the MuBira. "No, I must certainly kill you." And he took a piece of wood and tried to hit the crippled little pygmy girl. But the wood flew back in his face and hit him on the nose, and the blood streamed down. And with the blood still streaming down he ran back to his village and told everyone, "There is a poor deserted pygmy girl in the pygmy camp. She is crippled and diseased, and she has the evil eye. She will surely kill us all." And with some friends and relations he hurried to the deserted camp. There was the little girl, sitting on the swing, swinging herself back and forth, back and forth. The MuBira called to her. "Come here my poor child. You have killed one of our relatives, and you have wounded me. You are crippled and diseased, and you have been deserted. I am going to kill you." The little girl got down from her swing and slowly came over to where the MuBira was standing. "Come nearer, little one!" said the MuBira. "Oh, please don't kill me," said the pygmy girl, "I am only a deserted cripple, and I haven't run away." But she came closer still. The MuBira raised his knife. "Now! 'he said' Now I am going to kill you!" But the knife caught in his stomach, and he fell down, he fell <pb n="56"/>down dead. The girl went back to her swing, dragging her withered little legs along the ground. And she climbed on the swing and swung herself back and forth, back and forth. The remaining BaBira all hurried back to their village. "Come! Come! Come, all of you!" they cried. "There is a crippled little Pygmy girl in the deserted camp, and she will surely kill us all unless we kill her. Get your spears, and come!" And all the BaBira seized their spears and came running to the deserted camp. They all came to take their revenge and kill the deserted little pygmy girl. But the girl had gone. The only sign of life was the <rs type="animal">fifi bird</rs>, and the <rs type="animal">fifi bird</rs> was sitting on the <rs type="plant">rattan vine</rs>, swinging itself back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. <shift feature="epimyth"/>Basi ['That is all'].</p>
