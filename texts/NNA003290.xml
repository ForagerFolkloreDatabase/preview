        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>The time was when <rs type="animal">animal</rs> life was found on the earth. It happened that a <rs type="animal">mountain lion</rs><note>FFDB: Marlett 2022, p. 87, translates "<rs type="animal" ref="q:Q35255">Puma</rs>" (Puma concolor).</note> was passing by a certain place. Perhaps he was looking for <pb n="366"/>something to eat. As he was going along there he came to a cave in which there were some <rs type="animal" key="Sylvilagus sp." ref="q:Q40698246">cottontails</rs>. He grabbed one of them and held it down with his paw. Then the <rs type="animal">mountain lion</rs> spoke. "This <rs type="animal">cottontail</rs>'s back is all <rs type="color">yellow</rs>," he said. Then the <rs type="animal">cottontail</rs> spoke. "The reason for that is that I killed large male <rs type="animal">mountain lions</rs> and carried them on my back." Then the <rs type="animal">cottontail</rs> spoke to the other <rs type="animal">rabbits</rs>. "Bring out the <rs type="animal">mountain lion</rs>'s head that is over there and after I have eaten some of it I will go out and look for some more <rs type="animal">mountain lion</rs> tracks."</p>
      <p>So from inside the cave the other <rs type="animal">cottontails</rs> rolled out a <rs type="plant">cactus</rs> boot that <pb n="367"/>came from a dry <rs type="plant" key="Carnegiea gigantea" ref="q:Q275573">sahuaro</rs>, and when the <rs type="animal">mountain lion</rs> heard the raspy sound of the rolling <rs type="plant">cactus</rs> boot, he released the <rs type="animal"> cottontail</rs> and ran away. As he fled, the <rs type="animal">cottontails</rs> also tore out of there and ran away. After awhile they came to a large dry thicket, and when they had rushed inside, the <rs type="animal">cottontail</rs> that had fooled the <rs type="animal">mountain lion</rs> spoke to the others. "Let me lie down way in the back. It is because I fooled him that we got away."</p>
