        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,

        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p><persName>Kunmanggur</persName> had two daughters, <animal>Pilitman</animal>, The <animal latin="Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus">Green Parrot [ornithological identification uncertain]</animal> Women. They were the sisters of <persName>Tjinimin</persName>, The <animal>Bat</animal>. They were with <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> at <placeName>Kimul</placeName>. They said: "Father, we want to go that way," pointing towards the sea; "we want to find food." <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> sent them from <placeName>Kimul</placeName> towards the island known as <placeName>Nganangur</placeName>. He said: "Take this <plant>bottle-tree [bamnudut, baobab]</plant> and put it on that island.<note>Many Murinbata resent being told that horticulture and agriculture are unknown to them. They cite <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>'s instruction to his daughters that" making a garden "is an old Aboriginal custom. They interpret the presence of any natural species in an unexpected place as an intended result of human action in past time. The <plant>baobab</plant> grows sporadically, sometimes singly, sometimes in clusters, in unpredictable places, and this fact is taken to be evidence of human intent. It is especially plentiful on <placeName>Nganangur</placeName>.</note> You will find a good place there."</p>
      <p>The two girls went off, carrying digging-sticks. They went to the place known as <placeName>Mindjini-Mindjini</placeName>, and there began to gather many pieces of paperbark. Then they went on, to camp at <placeName>Were-Kurumbunuru</placeName>, near <placeName>Maiyilindi</placeName>. The next day they passed a big hill, and crossed over the big river near <placeName>Wakal-Tjinang</placeName>. They gathered paperbark at <placeName>Paiyer</placeName>, and divided the sheets of paperbark into two big heaps, one for each of them. Then they went on to <placeName>Nganangur</placeName> to look about for <animal>fish</animal> and <animal>crabs</animal>.</p>
      <p><persName>Tjinimin</persName> lusted after the girls. One had pubic hair, the other none. They were very pretty. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> did not care that they were his sisters or were of the Kartjin moiety, his own; he wanted them, and meant to follow them. He said to <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>: "Father I want to go that way," pointing in the direction in which <pb n="89"/>The <animal><color>Green</color> Parrot</animal> Women had gone; "I want to see The <animal latin="Pteropus">Flying Fox</animal> people." He was deceiving his father. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> wore his forehead-band (daral). His penis was still very sore and painful.<note>A sign of initiation. A subsidiary myth relates how <persName>Tjinimin</persName> had been subincised by <persName>Yuwirnga</persName>, one of the <animal latin="Pteropus">Flying Fox</animal> Brothers. The brothers, <persName>Walet</persName> and <persName>Yuwirnga</persName>, had started from <placeName>Nganarangga</placeName> to find a good country. They came to a place now known as <placeName>Karawupman</placeName> and there made a dreaming-place (ngoiguminggi). At that time <persName>Walet</persName> had a penis like a man. <persName>Yuwirnga</persName> took a sharp cutting-stone secretly and subincised <persName>Walet</persName>, so that he became ngi madaiyin. Later, he did the same to <persName>Tjinimin</persName>, and later still to all the people to the south (kadu tjiltji). All kadu tjiltji now call those from the north lamatingi, and say that they are not truly men. The Murinbata, who practise circumcision, apply the same term to the uncircumcised tribes to the north of the Daly River.</note> He followed the girls, but lost their track after <placeName>Mindjini-Mindjini</placeName>, where he veered to the west. He took another road passing through <placeName>Dangaiyer</placeName>. He killed a <animal>rock-wallaby</animal> and roasted it quickly because he thought the girls might be close. He put the <animal>wallaby</animal> on his shoulder to carry it but it burned his neck, so he dipped his burden in water. Then, still carrying the roasted <animal>wallaby</animal>, he came on the girls' track. On an open place, he saw the paperbark they had left. The girls were not there.</p>
      <p>When he saw the paperbark <persName>Tjinimin</persName> said: "Ah, this is theirs; they left it here." He knew they would come back. He took the <animal>wallaby</animal> to a jungle and hung it in a <plant>tree</plant>. Then he made a spear. He went to where the girls had made camp and saw some of their menstrual blood. At the sight, he had an erection. He took <color>white</color> paint, softened it in his mouth, and painted himself like an initiated man, and put on a pubic-covering. Then he moved the paperbark to another position, smoothing out all the marks where it had lain. He piled the sheets one by one on top of himself so that he was hidden underneath. He crossed his arms on his chest and, breathing through a small hole, waited, listening and sleeping alternately.</p>
      <p>After a long time the girls came. They had many <animal>mullet</animal> with them. They put down the <animal>fish</animal> and made a fire.<note>Some informants deny that the girls had fire, and say that the <animal>fish</animal> was to be eaten raw. It was <persName>Tjinimin</persName> who had fire "because he was man," implying that the girls were still <animal>birds</animal>. The variation suggests some doubt about <persName>Tjinimin</persName>'s moiety, for the mythology holds that in The Dream Time only Tiwunggu people had fire. The implicit suggestion is that he belonged to the Tiwunggu moiety.</note> They did not see <persName>Tjinimin</persName>. Then they noticed the changed position of the paperbark. "Oh, sister," said one, "look! a big wind must have done this." They began to sort out the sheets. "Whose is this?" "It is mine; put it here." "Whose is this?" "It is mine; put it there." At last, only one big sheet was left.</p>
      <p>As the last sheet was taken away, <persName>Tjinimin</persName> leaped out, laughing with glee and malice. The girls were startled. "Oh, my brother is here," said one. "Why have you come?" <persName>Tjinimin</persName> said: "My father<note>One informant, narrating the myth, said at this point, "Your kaka (mother's brother) sent me to find you two." Later, he reverted to the statement that <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> was the father of all three. When I questioned him, he was confused, saying that <persName>Tjinimin</persName> was a "little bit Tjalyeri," that is, belonged to the opposite moiety from <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>. The designation of <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> as father (yile) or mother's brother (kaka) seems to vary with the locus of the clan from which informants come. Those from clans nearest the Nangiomeri and Wagaman tend to favour the Tiwunggu moiety as <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>'s.</note> sent me to find you two." "Perhaps <pb n="90"/>you are pretending? My father did not tell me that." "No, my father said to bring you back." But <persName>Tjinimin</persName> was deceiving them. He showed them his erect penis, and spilled semen on the ground. The girls were very frightened. "What is that you have lost?" said one. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> replied: "It is nothing." He kept on laughing.</p>
      <p>He next told them to get the <animal>wallaby</animal>. The girls said: "No, you go for it; we are tired from coming through the <plant>mangroves</plant>." <persName>Tjinimin</persName> did so. He then invited the girls to eat of it. They refused, saying: "No, leave it until later; we will eat the <animal>fish</animal> before it is rotten." He said: "I will keep it for you. You will eat it bye-and-bye." They ate the <animal>fish</animal>, offering some to <persName>Tjinimin</persName>.</p>
      <p>As darkness came, he went for a walk, telling the girls to stay where they were. The sun was going down. He took off his pubic covering. <animal>Hornets</animal> came and stung his penis so that it swelled enormously. With the darkness, he returned to prepare a camp. He told the girls he would copulate with them. They said: "We cannot do that; we are your own sisters; you are our own brother." <persName>Tjinimin</persName> replied: "It does not matter; it is enough that I came alone; no one is here; no one can see; we must copulate." He threatened them that if they did not he might do something like Yerindi<note>Yerindi is song-sorcery, of which even sophisticated Aborigines of modern times remain in dread.</note> to them. The girls were very frightened. They said to each other: "Sister, who will go to him?" The younger said: "I have no pubic hair. You go." So the older sister went to him. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> made fire. The three slept thus: the younger <animal>Pilitman</animal> between two first, <persName>Tjinimin</persName> and the older <animal>Pilitman</animal> between the second and third fires.</p>
      <p>He copulated with the older girl, so that she cried out in pain: "Oh! Oh! brother! Oh! sister, come to me." The younger <animal>Pilitman</animal> was asleep; she did not hear. He did it to the older <animal>Pilitman</animal> again and again, leaving her half-dead. Her sister brought her water, and she slept as though dead. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> then copulated with the younger girl. She too cried out in pain: "Oh! Oh! brother!" She called out to her sister in vain.</p>
      <p>The next day the girls went to get water at the creek known as <placeName>Merngoiyi</placeName>. It was dry. They went back and said to <persName>Tjinimin</persName>: "Come, we will all go to-day." <persName>Tjinimin</persName> said: "No, let us stay here another day." The sisters said: "No, we had better go; we can sleep on the other side of the creek. We will carry the paper-bark; you can carry the <animal>kangaroo</animal>." But they told <persName>Tjinimin</persName> to wait while they went ahead to make a crossing. On their way through the jungle they danced, and the magic of the dance brought <animal>hornets</animal> to wait on <persName>Tjinimin</persName>'s path. When he came, they stung him everywhere, all over his body, so that he cried out in agony. But the girls called out: "Come quickly, the tide is coming." They stopped its motion by song-magic. "Hurry," they called out. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> was finding the <animal>kangaroo</animal> very heavy, and asked them to help him. "No, no," they called, "hurry. There is no water yet. The tide is shallow." When they were on the other side of the creek <pb n="91"/>they ran away. But the tide caught <persName>Tjinimin</persName>. It swept him away. The <animal>kangaroo</animal>, and his spear, womerah, pubic covering and firestick were all lost.</p>
      <p><persName>Tjinimin</persName>, still alive, put his feet on dry ground at <placeName>Panyida</placeName>, where there are rocks. He tried to make fire but, being without a firestick, failed. Taking [finding?] a new spear and womerah, he killed a <animal>kangaroo</animal>, and made a pubic-covering from its hair. Then he saw the smoke of a fire a long way away. He suspected that it had been made by the <animal>Pilitman</animal> women.</p>
      <p>He camped twice before he came close to it, and saw them sitting on a high hilltop. He called out to them: "Which way do I climb up?" The women pointed to a steep cliff, saying: "You must go there." <persName>Tjinimin</persName> tried to climb the cliff by many different ways, but failed each time. "You must make a rope and throw it down to me," he cried out. The women made a rope and let it down the cliff. They said to <persName>Tjinimin</persName>: "You hold the rope and we will pull you up." They pulled him up, up, up, almost to the top. Then they cut the rope. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> fell on to the rocks far below. He broke the bones of his legs, arms, shoulders and head.</p>
      <p>But he was clever, and full of tricks; the breath did not leave his body. He mended his own bones. Then he stretched himself, trying his limbs and muscles. "Ah," he said, "I had a good sleep. Those two women did not wake me up." Now he went another way.</p>
      <p><persName>Tjinimin</persName> broke a piece of <color>white</color> stone (malawat) and with it tried to cut his nose. The stone was too blunt. He tried another; it too was blunt; he threw it away. He went to <placeName>Tagundjiya</placeName>, and tried the stone there. It was no good. At another place, <placeName>Toinying</placeName>, he found a long stone. It was good; it cut sharply through his nose. He lay down and, by magic, restored his nose. "Oh, it is good."</p>
      <p>Now he returned to <placeName>Kimul</placeName>, where <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> was. <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> said: "My son, <persName>Kadu Punj</persName>, is returning." <persName>Tjinimin</persName> stayed for one day. Then he said to his father: "I am going that way." "Where?" <persName>Tjinimin</persName> pointed to the north. "I am going for a <plant>bamboo</plant>" [spear-shaft?, drone-pipe?].</p>
      <p>He found his na&#331;gun, <persName>Kiniming</persName>, The <animal latin="Buteogallus anthracinus">Black Hawk</animal>, at <placeName>Pulupulu</placeName>. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> was troubled by his bones. <persName>Kiniming</persName> asked him what was the matter. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> blamed the two women: "No one looked after me; I fell down on the stones." <persName>Kiniming</persName> gave him a <plant>bamboo</plant> [spear-shaft?] and asked if he had a spear-point. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> said: "Yes, I have a spear; it belongs to my father; I will put this stone-point on it." No one found out that it was his own spear.</p>
      <p><persName>Tjinimin</persName> went to a far place to search for a <plant>bamboo</plant> spear-shaft. He tried a malawat stone; it broke in half. He said: "I will leave here [to find] a good stone." Again he went a long way. At the place called <placeName>Kuradagunda</placeName> he made another spear but the shaft broke. He tried another; it broke. Then <persName>Tjinimin</persName> fitted a malawat stone to a spear, straightened the <plant>bamboo</plant> shaft, and bound it with waxed string. Taking the spear he went on and on, to <placeName>Kimul</placeName>, to that place where all came out.</p>
      <p>He visited all the people. He said to them: "Hear! We shall all dance at the open place at <placeName>Kimul</placeName>. <persName>Kanamgek, The Old One, The Leader-Friend</persName>, is there." <pb n="92"/>He gathered all the people, and they went towards <placeName>Kimul</placeName>. He said to <persName>Maminmanga</persName>, The <animal>Diver-Bird</animal>: "I cannot leave you here; you are the singing-man; you must come with me." <persName>Maminmanga</persName> brought a big <plant>bamboo</plant> for <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> called to come <persName>Kularkur</persName> The <animal>Brolga</animal>, the skilful dancer; <persName>Mundoigoi</persName> The <animal>Turkey</animal>; <persName>Tjimeri</persName> The <animal>Jabiru</animal>; The <animal>Ducks</animal> <persName>Laidpar</persName> and <persName>Ngulpi</persName>; and the <animal><color>Black</color> Kalawipi [unidentifiable]</animal> for the women's dance (mamburki). They all went, and came out at <placeName>Kimul</placeName>.</p>
      <p><persName>Tjinimin</persName> made fire all the way along the tops of hills. <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>, seeing the the smoke, said: "Oh, <persName>Tjinimin</persName> returns." All the tribes went with him. They were a great many, stretching over a great distance. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> went first to <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>, who asked him: "What news?" (murin). <persName>Tjinimin</persName> replied: "Many, many people are coming to dance. We shall have a big wa&#331;ga."</p>
      <p><persName>Maminmanga</persName> gave the drone-pipe to <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> and said: "I will sing." <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> began to play kidnork, kidnork, kidnork!, and <persName>Maminmanga</persName> to sing: </p>
      <lg type="song">
        <l>Kawawawandi, kawandi kawandi,</l>
        <l>Mutjinga tjalala, purima marata,</l>
        <l>Krrk, krrk, krrk, krrk.<note>The Murinbata are unable to give a translation. In all probability the song is in the language of another tribe, or includes archaic Murinbata words. Kawandi is reminiscent of the Djamindjing wandiwandi (an evil, non-human spirit), but mutjingga (old woman) and purima (wife) are Murinbata words.</note></l>
      </lg>
      <p><persName>Tjinimin</persName> danced. All danced. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> came close. All were dancing. The two <animal>Pilitman</animal> girls came and sat close to their father. <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> said to his son: "Which way have you come?" <persName>Tjinimin</persName> replied: "I have come from <placeName>Mungiri</placeName>." "You have brought something?" "Nothing." He had brought only his fire-stick and womerah. He had hidden his spear. The two girls were there now, with their father. They had told <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> what <persName>Tjinimin</persName> had done.</p>
      <p>There were many people, and much noise. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> danced so as to make the women desire him. He and <persName>Kularkur</persName> were the leaders. With many tricks and artifices, they danced close to the singing-man. Then <persName>Tjinimin</persName> spoke swiftly in the Wagaman language: "I am going to kill your father, I am going to kill your father." People did not understand, and said: "What is it you say?" <persName>Tjinimin</persName> answered: "I told <persName>Walumuma</persName> to get me water." <persName>Walumuma</persName> went to get water for him, carrying it in her hands. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> spilled the water without drinking.</p>
      <p>Again <persName>Maminmanga</persName> began to sing, <persName>Kanamgek</persName> to blow his pipe, and <persName>Tjinimin</persName> to dance. As he danced he called out swiftly: "I am going to kill your father." Again he spoke in the Wagaman language and not understanding, people asked: "What is it you say?" <persName>Tjinimin</persName> replied: "I said, 'bring me good water to drink.'" <persName>Walumuma</persName> brought him water in a water-carrier. Again <persName>Tjinimin</persName> spilled it, and again <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> blew his pipe, <persName>Maminmanga</persName> sang, and <persName>Tjinimin</persName> danced. As he danced he drew the hidden spear towards him by his toes. Again he spoke swiftly <pb n="93"/>in Wagaman; again they asked him what he had said; again he said that he wanted water to drink. To himself, he said, without words: "Not long now. From this place I will throw the spear." He went on calling for water and when they brought it he would spill it.</p>
      <p>Now all were tiring. They said: "How many more times shall we dance?" They counted three times more. <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> blew his pipe, <persName>Maminmanga</persName> sang, <persName>Tjinimin</persName> danced. "Soon I will spear your father." "What is that you say?" "Bring me good water quickly for I am hot from dancing." <persName>Walumuma</persName> ran and filled a water-carrier. "How many more dances?" "Two more!" <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> blew; <persName>Maminmanga</persName> sang &#8230; and then he stopped. <persName>Tjinimin</persName> ran in darkness close to the spear and privily moved it nearer. He said to himself: "Not long now, and I will throw it." All said to him: "What is that you say? Is the water there?" <persName>Tjinimin</persName> replied: "Dance once more!"</p>
      <p>Now, the other people danced, but <persName>Tjinimin</persName> ran to the spear, grasped it and came close. While they danced that time, and <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> blew his pipe, <persName>Tjinimin</persName> came close and did that thing. Prrp! [the sound of the womerah]. Trrr! [the sound of the spear]. [It hit] there in the back!</p>
      <p>"Yeeeeee! " cried <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>. He threw the drone-pipe in the water there. Pub! [the sound of falling]. <persName>The Old One, The Friend-Leader</persName>, is finished.</p>
      <p><persName>Walet</persName>, The <animal latin="Pteropus">Flying Foxes</animal>, transformed on the instant, flew away into the air, crying "Eeeee!". All the <animal>birds</animal> flew away. The children of <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> cried out in grief.</p>
      <p><persName>Tjinimin</persName> ran from that place, and, standing afar off, looked back, wondering what they would do. But no one revenged themselves upon him. They all cried out in grief, and went another way [flying, spreading out].</p>
      <p><persName>The Old One</persName> rolled about [in agony]. He plunged into the water at <placeName>Maiyiwa</placeName>. Bu! [the sound of plunging into water]. He cried out to his son, <persName>Nindji</persName>, The <animal latin="Pteropus alecto">Black Flying Fox</animal>: "Pull out the spear." <persName>Nindji</persName> did as his father bid. "Throw it." <persName>Nindji</persName> threw it afar. That spear is now at <placeName>Toinying</placeName>.</p>
      <p>He stayed at <placeName>Maiyiwa</placeName> for one moon. They made fire and put hot stones to his wound but to no avail; it did not heal; and water came out through the fire. "I cannot recover; better I should go away from here." So from there he went to the rock shelter at <placeName>Purmi</placeName>, where the great <plant>baobab</plant> is that comes from him. But he was still sick and, taking with him all his sons, The <animal latin="Pteropus">Flying Foxes</animal>, he went on.</p>
      <p>[The myth then lists a large number of places - of which I recorded thirty - which the dying <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> visited. At each place he rested, hoping for a soft-lying place, that his wound would heal; but at each place he met disappointment, and felt death coming nearer. At many, but not all, places his wives and sons dug a hole in the ground, made a fire to heat stones, and tried fruitlessly to staunch his bleeding wounds, and at each such place water came up through the flames. At <pb n="94"/>many places <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> performed many feats of wonder; as at <placeName>Kulindang</placeName>, where he left one of his three testicles; or at <placeName>Kiringjingin</placeName>, where he left his signs, in the shape of a body and footprints, on the wall of a vast cave; or at <placeName>Dirinbilin</placeName>, where his blood still seeps out through the rocks and water. At other places he left personal possessions: his stone-axe and fishing net at <placeName>Kiringjingin</placeName>, and his forehead-band at <placeName>Kandiwuli</placeName> in a pool of glass-like water. At last he turned towards the sea, eventually reaching a place which the myth leaves uncertain, but somewhere near <placeName>Blunder Bay</placeName> on the lower <placeName>Victoria River</placeName>.]</p>
      <p>Now <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> said to <persName>Pilirin</persName>, The <animal>Kestrel</animal>: "Hear! I am hungry for flesh-food. You hunt flesh for me!" So <persName>Pilirin</persName> took his spear and went. He speared a <animal>kangaroo</animal>, roasting it at <placeName>Palkanmi</placeName>. But <persName>Kunmanggur</persName> was now wearied and angry from his sickness. Slowly he gathered all the fire from that place and stood it on his head as though it were a head-dress (mutura). The people said to him: "Why do you do that?" He replied to them: "Stay silent; I shall take this fire forever for myself." He entered the water close to <placeName>Doitpir</placeName>. Slowly the water rose upon him to here &#8230; to here &#8230; to here &#8230; The people cried out to <persName>Kadpur</persName> The <animal>Butcher Bird</animal>: "He intends to take that fire into the water there!" <persName>Kadpur</persName> cried out to <persName>Pilirin</persName>: "Kai-i-i-i, kai-i-i-i, kai-i-i-i!" <persName>Pilirin</persName> heard the hail all the vast distance from <placeName>Palkanmi</placeName>. "Someone is calling out from there. What is [the unknown] trouble? I think it is [about] <persName>The Old One</persName>. I think they have lost <persName>The Old One, The Leader-Friend</persName>." He ran all the way to that place, ran without pause, and stopped only when he had come close.</p>
      <p><persName>Kunmanggur</persName> was now far out. The water rose on him to here &#8230; to here &#8230; to here &#8230; it was up to his chest. He went to the place known as <placeName>Lalalarda</placeName>, where he pushed out his legs to make the creek. <persName>Kadpur</persName> cried out to <persName>Pilirin</persName>: "<persName>The Old One</persName> has taken all the fire into the water. Hasten after him!" <persName>Kadpur</persName> ran [flew] swiftly to where only the fiery head-dress could now be seen. He ran [flew] to where the water was beginning to cover <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>'s head. Pit! [the sound of snatching]. He snatched the fire out of the water. But <persName>Kunmanggur</persName>'s fire was out! Finished!</p>
      <p><persName>Pilirin</persName> ran [flew] close to the people. He made fire with firesticks - this was the first time men had used fire-sticks [i.e. the fire-drill]. He set fire to the <plant>grass</plant> on all sides. To this day all that country looks fire-scorched. That is from what <persName>Pilirin</persName> did.</p>
      <p><persName>Kunmanggur</persName> thrashed around in the water and made it turbulent with foam. He thrust out his legs! Now a creek is there. That place is <placeName>Tjuliyel</placeName>. He thrust out his legs! Now at <placeName>Purulunjnu</placeName> and <placeName>Turubilin</placeName> little creeks are there. He rolled about! Now came that big creek men call <placeName>Doitpir</placeName>. Where he splashed about at <placeName>Mendiputj</placeName> men now swim across straightway to <placeName>Kudunnyinggal</placeName>.</p>
      <p>That place at <placeName>Doitpir</placeName>, where he went into the water, is <placeName>da lurutj kalegale ya kalegale ("place" + "mighty, strong" + "mother, mother" + intensive particle + "mother, mother")</placeName>!</p>
