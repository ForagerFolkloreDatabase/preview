        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>Two <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeen</rs> brothers went out hunting. One brother was much younger than the other and smaller, so when they sighted an <rs type="animal">emu</rs>, the elder one said to the younger: "You stay quietly here and do not make a noise, or <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs>, whose camp we passed just now, will hear you and steal the <rs type="animal">emu</rs> if I kill it. He is so strong. I'll go on and try to kill the <rs type="animal">emu</rs> with this stone." The little <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeen</rs> watched his big brother sneak up to the <rs type="animal">emu</rs>, crawling along, almost flat, on the ground. He saw him get quite close to the <rs type="animal">emu</rs>, then spring up quickly and throw the stone with such an accurate aim as to kill the <rs type="animal">bird</rs> on the spot. The little brother was so rejoiced that he forgot his brother's caution, and he called aloud in his <pb n="20"/>joy. The big <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeen</rs> looked round and gave him a warning sign, but too late, <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs> had heard the cry and was hastening towards them. Quickly big <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeen</rs> left the <rs type="animal">emu</rs> and joined his little brother.</p>
      <p><rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs>, when he came up, said: "What have you found?"</p>
      <p>"Nothing," said the big <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeen</rs>, "nothing but some <rs type="plant">mistletoe</rs> berries."</p>
      <p>"It must have been something more than that, or your little brother would not have called out so loudly."</p>
      <p>Little <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeen</rs> was so afraid that <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs> would find their <rs type="animal">emu</rs> and take it, that he said: "I hit a little <rs type="animal">bird</rs> with a stone, and I was glad I could throw so straight."</p>
      <p>"It was no cry for the killing of a little <rs type="animal">bird</rs> or for the finding of <rs type="plant">mistletoe</rs> berries that I heard. It was for something much more than either, or you would not have called out so joyfully. If you do not tell me at once I will kill you both."</p>
      <p>The <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeen</rs> brothers were frightened, for <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs> was a great fighter and very strong, so when they saw he was really angry, they showed him the dead <rs type="animal">emu</rs>.</p>
      <p>"Just what I want for my supper," he said, and so saying, dragged it away to his own camp. The <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> followed him and even helped him to make a fire to cook the <rs type="animal">emu</rs>, hoping by so doing to get a share given to them. But <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs> would not give them any; he said he must have it all for himself.</p>
      <p>Angry and disappointed, the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> marched straight off and told some <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows who lived near, that <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs> had a fine fat <rs type="animal">emu</rs> just cooked for supper.</p>
      <p>Up jumped the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows, seized their spears, bade <pb n="21"/>the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> quickly lead them to <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs>'s camp, promising them for so doing a share of the <rs type="animal">emu</rs>.</p>
      <p>When they were within range of spear shot, the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows formed a circle, took aim, and threw their spears at <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs>. As the spears fell thick on him, sticking out all over him, <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs> cried aloud: "Bingehlah, Bingehlah. You can have it, you can have it." But the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows did not desist until <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs> was too wounded even to cry out; then they left him a mass of spears and turned to look for the <rs type="animal">emu</rs>. But to their surprise they found it not. Then for the first time they missed the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs>.</p>
      <p>Looking round they saw their tracks going to where the <rs type="animal">emu</rs> had evidently been; then they saw that they had dragged the <rs type="animal">emu</rs> to their <rs ref="g:GIP0247.110">nyunnoo</rs>, which was a humpy made of <rs type="plant">grass</rs>.</p>
      <p>When the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> saw the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows coming, they caught hold of the <rs type="animal">emu</rs> and dragged it to a big hole they knew of, with a big stone at its entrance, which stone only they knew the secret of moving. They moved the stone, got the <rs type="animal">emu</rs> and themselves into the hole, and the stone in place again before the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows reached the place.</p>
      <p>The <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows tried to move the stone, but could not. Yet they knew that the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> must have done so, for they had tracked them right up to it, and they could hear the sound of their voices on the other side of it. They saw there was a crevice on either side of the stone, between it and the ground. Through these crevices they drove in their spears, thinking they must surely kill the brothers. But the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> too had seen these <pb n="22"/>crevices and had anticipated the spears, so they had placed the dead <rs type="animal">emu</rs> before them to act as a shield. And into its body were driven the spears of the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows extended for the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs>.</p>
      <p>Having driven the spears well in, the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows went off to get help to move the stone, but when they had gone a little way they heard the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> laughing. Back they came and speared again, and again started for help, only as they left to hear once more the laughter of the brothers.</p>
      <p>The <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> finding their laughter only brought back the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows to a fresh attack, determined to keep quiet, which, after the next spearing, they did.</p>
      <p>Quite sure, when they heard their spear shots followed by neither conversation nor laughter, that they had killed the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> at last, the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows hurried away to bring back the strength and cunning of the camp, to remove the stone.</p>
      <p>The <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> hurriedly discussed what plan they had better adopt to elude the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows, for well they knew that should they ever meet any of them again they would be killed without mercy. And as they talked they satisfied their hunger by eating some of the <rs type="animal">emu</rs> flesh.</p>
      <p>After a while the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows returned, and soon was the stone removed from the entrance. Some of them crept into the hole, where, to their surprise, they found only the remains of the <rs type="animal">emu</rs> and no trace of the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs>. As those who had gone in first crept out and told of the disappearance of the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs>, others, incredulous of such a story, crept in to find it confirmed. They searched round for tracks; seeing that their spears were all in the <pb n="23"/>emu it seemed to them probable the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs> had escaped alive, but if so, whither they had gone their tracks would show. But search as they would no tracks could they find. All they could see were two little <rs type="animal">birds</rs> which sat on a <rs type="plant">bush</rs> near the hole, watching the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows all the time. The little <rs type="animal">birds</rs> flew round the hole sometimes, but never away, always returning to their <rs type="plant">bush</rs> and seeming to be discussing the whole affair; but what they said the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows could not understand. But as time went on and no sign was ever found of the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs>, the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows became sure that the brothers had turned into the little <rs type="color">white</rs>-throated <rs type="animal">birds</rs> which had sat on the <rs type="plant">bush</rs> by the hole, so, they supposed, to escape their vengeance. <shift feature="epimyth"/>And ever afterwards the little <rs type="color">white</rs>-throats were called <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.125">Weeoombeens</rs>. And the memory of <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.115">Piggiebillah</rs> is perpetuated by a sort of <rs type="animal">porcupine ant-eater</rs>, which bears his name, and whose skin is covered closely with miniature spears sticking all over it.</p>
