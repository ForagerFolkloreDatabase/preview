        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>A Warrau man warned his sister not to bathe in a certain neighboring pond at those regular periods when she happened to be unwell [Sect. 188]. For a long time she obeyed his instructions, but after a time, forgetting all about them, she went to bathe at the forbidden spot and time, and was caught by a large <rs type="animal">snake</rs>, the water-camudi Uamma. By and by she became pregnant. Now it was during the <rs type="plant" key="Mimusops belata">bullet-tree</rs> [Mimusops belata] season, when the Indians used to cut down the <rs type="plant">trees</rs> to secure the seed, which are excellent eating, and it was noticed that this same woman, although she took no ax away with her in the morning, invariably returned with a large quantity of the delicious seed in the afternoon. The brother, thereupon becoming suspicious, watched her. Unobserved himself, he followed her next day, saw her approach a huge <rs type="plant">bullet-tree</rs>, and saw the Uamma <rs type="animal">snake</rs> [Sect. 244] sneaking out of the woman's body, coil around the <rs type="plant">tree</rs>, and make his way up into the topmost branches. There the <rs type="animal">snake</rs> changed into a man, who shook the boughs for the woman, thus causing the seeds to fall to the ground, where she gathered them. Having done this, the Uamma, reverting to his original form, descended the <rs type="plant">tree</rs>, and again <pb n="144"/>entered the woman's body. Thereupon the brother said, "There is something wrong here; this will not do: My sister probably has a <rs type="animal">snake</rs> in her body." So he told his friends who, in company with him, watched his sister the next day, when the same thing took place, Uamma sneaking out below the woman's body, climbing the <rs type="plant">tree</rs>, changing into human form, shaking the seeds down, and then becoming a <rs type="animal">snake</rs> again. But just as Uamma was about to reach the ground, the watchers rushed up and cut him into thousands of pieces. The woman grieved sorely, but collected all the fragments under a heap of mold and leaves, each piece of which by and by grew into a Carib. Many years passed; the Caribs growing strong and numerous, became a nation. They lived in harmony with the Warraus, so much so that when one tribe caught some game or other dainty, they would send a child with a piece of it over to the Warraus. The latter would then return the compliment and send a child of theirs with food to the Caribs. This lasted a long time, until one day the original mother of the Caribs - a very old woman now - told them to kill the child which the Warraus had sent to them; this was in revenge for the way the Warraus had slain her <rs type="animal">snake</rs> lover years before. As might have been expected, the Warraus on the next occasion slaughtered the Carib child, and thus a blood feud arose between the two nations, the Caribs finally overwhelming the Warraus.</p>
