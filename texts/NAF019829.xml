        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>There was once a pygmy named <persName>Butuwa</persName>. He was in the forest, and was sleeping with his wife, children, and old mother. His mother had no legs. In the middle of the night <persName>Butuwa</persName> said to his wife, "Mother is sleeping soundly, get the children together and let's go away." So they quietly picked up their belongings, and together with their children they crept away. They walked and walked and walked. Early in the morning the old woman woke up. She said, "Where is everybody? Oh! They are a bad family, they have gone off and left their legless old mother to die. I will follow them." And so saying, she stood on her head and walked and walked and walked until she caught up with them, walking on her head. She was very angry with them for having deserted her, and told them how bad they were to have left her alone in the forest. That night they all went to sleep together. In the middle of the night the pygmy said to his wife, "Now mother is really asleep, get the children together and let's go away." So they collected the children, picked up their belongings and stole away. They walked and walked and walked. Early in the morning the old woman woke up and she was very, very angry to find that her family had deserted her again. So she stood on her head and she walked and walked and walked, until she caught up with them, walking on her head. She told her son how bad he was. She was very cross indeed. Her son went off into the forest and gathered some honey. And then he got a very bad <rs type="animal">worm</rs> and put it in the honey. He returned to the camp, and said, "Don't be angry with me, Mother, look, I have brought you some fine honey." And the legless old mother ate up the honey, <rs type="animal">worm</rs> and all. And the <rs type="animal">worm</rs> ate up the legless old mother's stomach, and the legless old mother died. Butuwa left and went to another camp where they had relations. When they got to the camp, their relations asked, "What news? Where is your mother?" "Oh! She died," said <persName>Butuwa</persName>. "That's too bad", said the others. <shift feature="epimyth"/>Basi ['That is all'].</p>
