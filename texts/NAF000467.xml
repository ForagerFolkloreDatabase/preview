        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>Once upon a time, <apartmyth>as the people say</apartmyth>, the <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> persuaded the <animal>hare</animal> to go with him to be servants to a man, who lived far away. The <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> was hungry, and he wanted to deceive the <animal>hare</animal>. This man was a hunter, and not long before this, not long before they went to be his servants, he had killed a big <animal>buck</animal>. He had all the fat of the <animal>buck</animal> in his house. Now the <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> wanted to steal that fat, but he wanted the man to blame the <animal>hare</animal> for the theft. So one night, when everyone was asleep, he got up, and ate all the fat. When he had quite finished that fat, he took some of it and he smeared it upon the <animal>hare</animal>'s face, and her fore feet. Then he lay down again. Next morning the man, when he awoke, he missed his fat. Knowing what the <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal>'s life was, he immediately accused him of being the thief. The <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> at once said, "Not I, look at the <animal>hare</animal>'s mouth, look at her fore feet, and you will see who is the thief." The man was so very angry that he cut a big stick out of the <plant>bush</plant>, and he caught the <animal>hare</animal> by the ear. He thrashed the <animal>hare</animal> so much that she died; but she died saying that she had never eaten any of the man's fat, and that the <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> was a liar. <epimyth>This is the end of the tale.</epimyth></p>
