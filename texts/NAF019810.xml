        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>Two men went to their camp. While they were walking through the forest they came across a <rs type="plant">tree</rs> called <rs type="plant">pusia</rs>, which bears delicious nuts. One of the men gathered nuts from this <rs type="plant">tree</rs>, but the other gathered from another <rs type="plant">tree</rs>, whose nuts were very bitter. When they reached their camp they roasted their nuts over the fire. The man with the bitter nuts offered them to his friend. His friend tasted them and said "Oh! These are terrible, I can't eat them." And the two of them shared the sweet nuts. Later on the man with the bitter nuts went back to the <rs type="plant">tree</rs> and stole the rest of the sweet nuts and roasted them over the fire. When they were ready he offered them to his friend. His friend tasted them and said, "These are sweet, they must be my nuts. You have stolen my nuts." "I wouldn't steal your nuts!" "Well, tomorrow I'll go and see." At first light the man who had found the sweet nuts went to his <rs type="plant">tree</rs>, and saw that all the nuts were gone. Here turned to the camp and told his friend what he had found. "You see, you did steal all my nuts. You can stay here no longer."</p>
      <p>So the man who stole the nuts left the camp and went through the forest until he came to a <rs type="animal">konga bird</rs>. When he saw the <rs type="animal">konga bird</rs> he explained what had happened and said, "Please, don't kill me." The <rs type="animal">konga bird</rs> said, "All right, you can stay here and look after us." In the mean-time the other pygmy, his nuts all eaten, decided to follow his friend. When he finally arrived his friend said to the <rs type="animal">konga bird</rs>, "There is my brother whose sweet nuts I stole. You can kill him if you like." So together they killed the pygmy who had allowed himself to be tricked. <shift feature="epimyth"/>Basi ['That is all'].</p>
