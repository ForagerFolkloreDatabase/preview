        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>A <animal latin="Felis leo">lion</animal> and a <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> went to hunt one day. They came in sight of a lot of <animal latin="Taurotragus oryx">elands</animal>, and the <animal latin="Felis leo">lion</animal> shot with his bow and missed his <animal>buck</animal>. Then the <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> tried and hit his <animal latin="Taurotragus oryx">eland</animal>. The <animal latin="Felis leo">lion</animal> was angry and called out, "I have hit, you haves missed." Now the <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> was afraid, and agreed with the <animal latin="Felis leo">lion</animal> and said, "Yes, you have hit." After that they went home to have a sleep, intending to come back, to cut up the meat. As soon as the <animal latin="Felis leo">lion</animal> was asleep, the <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> went back to the dead <animal>buck</animal>, and tearing out its belly crawled into it, and began to eat all the best part of the fat round the heart.</p>
      <p>The <animal latin="Felis leo">lion</animal> awoke and immediately came to the carcase, and saw the <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal>'s tail sticking out of the dead <animal latin="Taurotragus oryx">eland</animal>. So the <animal latin="Felis leo">lion</animal> caught him by the tail, and swung him out, and ordered him to stand at a distance. Afterwards the <animal latin="Felis leo">lion</animal> gave the <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> some small pieces of meat to eat, and told him to take some of the best of the fat to the <animal latin="Felis leo">lion</animal>'s wife and children, but the <animal latin="Canis mesomelas">jackal</animal> took the fat to his own wife and children, and then he fled quite away with his own wife and children to another part of the country. <epimyth>The tale is ended.</epimyth></p>
