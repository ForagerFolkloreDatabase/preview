        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>Once the fire went out in all the houses. Only the <rs type="animal">snake</rs> had fire. The young girls went to ask him for fire. "If you will become my wives I will give you fire," said he. "No we do not want to," said the girls, "we do not want a <rs type="animal">snake</rs> for husband. It will be so difficult to sleep together." Two sisters went also to ask the <rs type="animal">snake</rs> for fire. "I'll give you fire if you marry me," replied he. The sisters agreed. The <rs type="animal">snake</rs> then gave them rings and returned with the two sisters to their house. The girls told everybody that they had married the <rs type="animal">snake</rs>. In the evening they cooked <rs type="plant">rice</rs> and ate. When they had eaten they went to sleep. There was still some <rs type="plant">rice</rs> left in the saucepan. The <rs type="animal">snake</rs> did not eat. <shift feature="apartmyth"/><rs type="animal">Snakes</rs> do not eat cooked <rs type="plant">rice</rs>.<shift feature="diegesis"/> The girls slept at one end of the house, and the <rs type="animal">snake</rs> slept at the other end. Once the sisters were fast asleep, the <rs type="animal">snake</rs>, who was really a man who wore a <rs type="animal">snake</rs> "cloak" (<rs ref="g:GEE2143.004">bajo</rs> tal√≤den), took off his <rs type="animal">snake</rs> cloak and became a real man. He ate the rest of the <rs type="plant">rice</rs> in the saucepan. He smoked tobacco which he took from the girls' tobacco pouches. Then he ate their <rs type="plant">betel</rs> nuts. Having finished this he went over to where his two wives were sleeping and lay down between and went to sleep. As it began to get <rs type="color">light</rs> he got up, put on his <rs type="animal">snake</rs> cloak again and went back to his own sleeping place. In the morning the girls said they would finish off the rest of the <rs type="plant">rice</rs> from the night before, but when they went to get it, they saw that the saucepan was empty. "Who has eaten the <rs type="plant">rice</rs>?" the older sister asked the younger. "l do not know, I was fast asleep all night," she replied. During the day the other girls in the settlement - those who had refused to marry the <rs type="animal">snake</rs> - came to have a look. They thought that the <rs type="animal">snake</rs> would have gobbled up his two wives.</p>
      <p>In the evening the girls cooked <rs type="plant">rice</rs> which they ate. There was still quite a lot left in the saucepan when they had finished. Then they went to sleep. When the <rs type="animal">snake</rs> saw that they were fast asleep, he took off his <rs type="animal">snake</rs> cloak as he had done the night before, ate up the rest of the <rs type="plant">rice</rs>, smoked tobacco, ate <rs type="plant">betel</rs> nuts, and then lay down to sleep between his two wives. Before sunrise he got up, put his <rs type="animal">snake</rs> cloak back on and returned to his own sleeping quarters. In the morning the girls wanted to eat the rest of the <rs type="plant">rice</rs>, but found that there was nothing left. During the day the other people in the settlement came to have a look to see if they were still alive or whether the <rs type="animal">snake</rs> had swallowed them. But the girls assured everybody that there was no problem in being the <rs type="animal">snake</rs>'s wives.</p>
      <p>The same thing went on for several nights, and finally the girls decided to find out who it was who was eating their <rs type="plant">rice</rs>, smoking their tobacco and eating their <rs type="plant">betel</rs> nuts. They went into the jungle and found some nuts that looks very much like <rs type="plant">betel</rs>, but are poisonous. Then they picked some leaves that look like <rs ref="g:GEE2143.038">sireh</rs> leaves, but are very bitter, and with these they replaced their real <rs type="plant">betel</rs> nuts and <rs ref="g:GEE2143.038">sireh</rs> leaves. In the evening after they had eaten, they pretended to go to sleep. The <rs type="animal">snake</rs> thought that they were asleep and took off his <rs type="animal">snake</rs> cloak and went to eat the <rs type="plant">rice</rs>. The girls got up and took his <rs type="animal">snake</rs> cloak and crumpled it up between <pb n="18"/>their fingers. Then they went back, pretending to be asleep. When the <rs type="animal">snake</rs>-man ate the '<rs type="plant">betel</rs>-nuts' and the '<rs ref="g:GEE2143.038">sireh</rs> leaves' he shouted "This tastes horrible." The girls got up and when he saw them he looked everywhere for his <rs type="animal">snake</rs> cloak. "Where is my cloak? Where is my shirt? My original cloak!" he cried. His wives told him that they had destroyed it because they wanted a real husband. They then gave him a real cloak (<rs ref="g:GEE2143.004">bajo</rs>) to wear and from then on the <rs type="animal">snake</rs>-man was a real man.</p>
      <p>The next day all the young girls came to have a look at the <rs type="animal">snake</rs> husband. When they saw the handsome man, they became very ashamed because they had refused to marry him.</p>
