        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

        <note><persName>Tanko</persName> is the superhuman being who, together with the Original <rs type="animal">Snake</rs> punishes those <rs ref="g:GEE2143.041">talaiden</rs> offences which involve laughing at <rs type="animal">animals</rs>. (see "<rs type="animal">Snake</rs> Talaiden One" and "Two") He is also a punisher of incest, an offence known simply as <persName>tanko</persName>. The present myth is the only direct "theological" evidence the Chawong have for the incest rule, and it refers only to that between aunt and nephew.</note>
      </p>
      <p>A long time ago everybody went to plant <rs type="plant">hill rice</rs> in a newly cleared swidden. Only a young man and his aunt (<rs ref="g:GEE2143.016">deh√©</rs>) were at home. They took turns in picking <rs type="animal">lice</rs> of each other's hair.<note>The only adult people of opposite sex who may pick <rs type="animal">lice</rs> out of each other's hair are husband and wife. To do so indicates physical intimacy and is a metaphorical way of talking about sexual union. This myth is quoted when the Chewong explain <persName>Tanko</persName>'s role as punisher of "incest," <rs ref="g:GEE2143.042">tanko</rs>. (See also Part IV)</note> <persName>Tanko</persName> came down from his house in the clouds. He went up to an old man planting <rs type="plant">rice</rs> and greeted him. He saw the aunt in the distance. "That is a very pretty girl," he said, "I want to have a closer look at her." He went up to the house where the two were picking <rs type="animal">lice</rs>. "Your aunt is very attractive," he said to the young man. "l want to sleep with her," he added. "Well, that is up to the girl herself," said the man. "I don't want to," said the girl. "Come with me into the forest and we will sleep together," insisted <persName>Tanko</persName>. But the girl refused. "I will come back later and we will get married," <persName>Tanko</persName> told her. He returned to the swidden and told the old man that he was going home, but that he would return in seven days in order to marry the girl. Having said this, <persName>Tanko</persName> went up to his own house.</p>
      <p>Seven days later <persName>Tanko</persName> sent down a ray of lightning with which he picked up the girl and her nephew. He pulled them into his house in the clouds. First he took the aunt, laid her over a piece of wood, hit her over the head and threw her to his <rs type="animal">dogs</rs>, which ate her. Then he picked up the nephew, laid him over a piece of wood and hit him on the head. Having done this, he threw him to his <rs type="animal">dogs</rs> as well. <shift feature="epimyth"/><persName>Tanko</persName> had lied about wanting to marry the girl. He only wanted food for his <rs type="animal">dogs</rs>.</p>
