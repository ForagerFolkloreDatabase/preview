        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p><animal>Crab (bali)</animal> was mutji&#331;ga (very old woman). She was very sick. Everyone thought she was dead. They buried her in a hole. But she was not dead. She stayed there about five days. She made a new shell and left the old one in the ground.</p>
      <p><animal>Crow</animal> was there waiting. The people were crying. Yau! <animal>Crab</animal> was there! The mutji&#331;ga came back. Everyone was happy. <animal>Crow</animal> was angry. He said to <animal>Crab</animal>: "That way takes too long. This is what we people must do." He plucked <animal>Crab</animal>'s eyes out. Then he died immediately.</p>
