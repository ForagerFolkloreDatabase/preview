        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary

        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>Old <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName> said to his two young wives, <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.011">Birrahgnooloo</rs></persName> and <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.038">Cunnunbeillee</rs></persName>, "I have stuck a <rs type="color">white</rs> feather between the hind legs of a <rs type="animal">bee</rs>, and am going to let it go and then follow it to its nest, that I may get honey. While I go for the honey, go you two out and get <rs type="animal">frogs</rs> and <rs type="plant">yams</rs>, then meet me at <placeName>Coorigel Spring</placeName>, where we will camp, for sweet and clear is the water there." The wives, taking their goolays and <rs type="plant">yam</rs> sticks, went out as he told them. Having gone far, and dug out many <rs type="plant">yams</rs> and <rs type="animal">frogs</rs>, they were tired when they reached <placeName>Coorigel</placeName>, and, seeing the cool, fresh water, they longed to bathe. But first they built a bough shade, and there left their goolays holding their food, and the <rs type="plant">yams</rs> and <rs type="animal">frogs</rs> they had found. When their camp was ready for the coming of <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName>, who having wooed his wives with a <rs ref="g:GIP0247.108">nullah-nullah</rs>, kept them obedient by fear of the same weapon, then went the girls to the spring to bathe. Gladly they plunged in, having first divested themselves of their <rs ref="g:GIP0247.073">goomillahs</rs>, which they were still young enough to wear, and which they left on the ground near the spring. Scarcely were they enjoying the cool rest the water gave their hot, tired limbs, when they were seized <pb n="12"/>and swallowed by two <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs>. Having swallowed the girls, the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs> dived into an opening in the side of the spring, which was the entrance to an underground watercourse leading to the <placeName>Narran River</placeName>. Through this passage they went, taking all the water from the spring with them into the <placeName>Narran</placeName>, whose course they also dried as they went along.</p>
      <p>Meantime <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName>, unwitting the fate of his wives, was honey hunting. He had followed the <rs type="animal">bee</rs> with the <rs type="color">white</rs> feather on it for some distance; then the <rs type="animal">bee</rs> flew on to some <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.058">budtha flowers</rs>, and would move no further. <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName> said, "Something has happened, or the <rs type="animal">bee</rs> would not stay here and refuse to be moved on towards its nest. I must go to <placeName>Coorigel Spring</placeName> and see if my wives are safe. Something terrible has surely happened." And <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName> turned in haste towards the spring. When he reached there he saw the bough shed his wives had made, he saw the <rs type="plant">yams</rs> they had dug from the ground, and he saw the <rs type="animal">frogs</rs>, but <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.011">Birrahgnooloo</rs></persName> and <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.038">Cunnunbeillee</rs></persName> he saw not. He called aloud for them. But no answer. He went towards the spring; on the edge of it he saw the <rs ref="g:GIP0247.073">goomillahs</rs> of his wives. He looked into the spring and, seeing it dry, he said, "It is the work of the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs>; they have opened the underground passage and gone with my wives to the river, and opening the passage has dried the spring. Well do I know where the passage joins the <placeName>Narran</placeName>, and there will I swiftly go." Arming himself with spears and woggarahs he started in pursuit. He soon reached the deep hole where the underground channel of the <placeName>Coorigel</placeName> joined the <placeName>Narran</placeName>. There he saw what he had never seen before, namely, this deep hole dry. And he said: <pb n="13"/>"They have emptied the holes as they went along, taking the water with them. But well know I the deep holes of the river. I will not follow the bend, thus trebling the distance I have to go, but I will cut across from big hole to big hole, and by so doing I may yet get ahead of the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs>. " On swiftly sped <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName>, making short cuts from big hole to big hole, and his track is still marked by the <rs ref="g:GIP0247.100">morilla</rs> ridges that stretch down the <placeName>Narran</placeName>, pointing in towards the deep holes. Every hole as he came to it he found dry, until at last he reached the end of the <placeName>Narran</placeName>; the hole there was still quite wet and muddy, then he knew he was near his enemies, and soon he saw them. He managed to get, unseen, a little way ahead of the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs>. He hid himself behind a big <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.046">dheal tree</rs>. As the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs> came near they separated, one turning to go in another direction. Quickly <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName> hurled one spear after another, wounding both <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs>, who writhed with pain and lashed their tails furiously, making great hollows in the ground, which the water they had brought with them quickly filled. Thinking they might again escape him, <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName> drove them from the water with his spears, and then, at close quarters, he killed them with his woggarahs. And ever afterwards at flood time, the <placeName>Narran</placeName> flowed into this hollow which the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs> in their writhings had made.</p>
      <p>When <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName> saw that the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs> were quite dead, he cut them open and took out the bodies of his wives. They were covered with wet slime, and seemed quite lifeless; but he carried them and laid them on two nests of <rs type="color">red</rs> <rs type="animal">ants</rs>. Then he sat down at some little distance and watched them. The <rs type="animal">ants</rs> quickly covered the bodies, <pb n="14"/>cleaned them rapidly of the wet slime, and soon <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName> noticed the muscles of the girls twitching. "Ah," he said, "there is life, they feel the sting of the <rs type="animal">ants</rs>."</p>
      <p>Almost as he spoke came a sound as of a thunder-clap, but the sound seemed to come from the ears of the girls. And as the echo was dying away, slowly the girls rose to their feet. For a moment they stood apart, a dazed expression on their faces. Then they clung together, shaking as if stricken with a deadly fear. But <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName> came to them and explained how they had been rescued from the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs> by him. He bade them to beware of ever bathing in the deep holes of the <placeName>Narran</placeName>, lest such holes be the haunt of <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.085">kurreahs</rs>.</p>
      <p>Then he bade them look at the water now at <placeName>Boogira</placeName>, and he said:</p>
      <p>"Soon will the <rs type="animal"><rs type="color">black</rs> swans</rs> find their way here, the <rs type="animal">pelicans</rs> and the <rs type="animal">ducks</rs>; where there was dry land and stones in the past, in the future there will be water and <rs type="animal">water-fowl</rs>, from henceforth; when the <placeName>Narran</placeName> runs it will run into this hole, and by the spreading of its waters will a big lake be made." <shift feature="epimyth"/>And what <persName><rs ref="g:GIP0247.032">Byamee</rs></persName> said has come to pass, as the <placeName>Narran Lake</placeName> shows, with its large sheet of water, spreading for miles, the home of thousands of wild <rs type="animal">fowl</rs>.</p>
