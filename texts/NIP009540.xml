        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

This is what we people should do [in order to die the right way]." She went into a hole. She stayed there changing her shell. She made a new shell. She threw the old one away.</p>
      <p><rs type="animal">Crow</rs> was there waiting. He went to search for <rs type="animal">Crab</rs>. He looked in the hole. He said: "This way takes too long. It takes too long to get strong this way." He went back to the waiting-place. <rs type="animal">Crab</rs> stayed in the hole until her shell was thick and strong. Then she came back. She said to <rs type="animal">Crow</rs>: "That is what we should do." <rs type="animal">Crow</rs> said: "No, it takes too long. Someone might come and kill [hurt] us. There is an easier way to die. This is what we should do." He rolled his eyes, fell down backwards, and died at once.</p>
