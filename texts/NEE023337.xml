        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>A long time ago the moon fell down from the sky. As there was no longer a moon the nights were very dark. One day <persName>Bongso</persName> was out hunting with his <rs type="animal">dog</rs>. He came to <placeName>Klau Kecil River</placeName> near <placeName>Mount Pallas</placeName>.<note>The Chewong used to live at the headwater of the <placeName>Klau Kecil River</placeName>, which is on <placeName>Mount Pallas</placeName> in <placeName>Central Pahang</placeName>. When the Chinese made plantations on <placeName>Mount Pallas</placeName>, they withdrew to the area around <placeName>Mount Benom</placeName>, to the <placeName>Krau River</placeName> area.</note> His eyes lit upon a beautiful woman down in the water. <persName>Bongso</persName>'s <rs type="animal">dog</rs> ran up towards her, but before he reached the woman, the <rs type="animal">dog</rs> fell down dead. He had shown disrespect, <rs ref="g:GEE2143.048">tolah</rs><note>See "Ta º Tatrahoi." Again the moon is singled out as particularly vulnerable to <rs ref="g:GEE2143.048">tolah</rs>.</note>. <persName>Bongso</persName> looked at the woman. "Oh, don't be frightened. I am the moon," said she. "I fell down from the sky and I cannot get back up again. Can you help me?" "I could, but I am frightened of <rs ref="g:GEE2143.048">tolah</rs>," replied <persName>Bongso</persName>. "No, no, don't be frightened," insisted the moon. "But I am. My <rs type="animal">dog</rs> died when he went close to you," said <persName>Bongso</persName>. "No, truly you need not be frightened. No harm will come to you" the moon told him, "I want to go home, but I have been in this river for three days unable to move out of it." When he heard this <persName>Bongso</persName> went up to the moon and pulled her out. The moon gave <persName>Bongso</persName> a tobacco pouch<note>A tobacco pouch is one of the gifts that a young girl is expected to give her husband-to-be.</note>, and they slept together. The next day <persName>Bongso</persName> returned to his own settlement. The people there were very upset because the moon had vanished from the sky and there was total darkness at night. "No, she has not vanished, she has fallen in the river," <persName>Bongso</persName> told them, "she wants help to return to the sky, so she asked all of us if we want to help her. The people said that they would help to get the moon back to the sky, they missed not seeing her at night. So they prepared to <rs ref="g:GEE2143.025">n√∂poh</rs>. They collected and made head bands, <rs ref="g:GEE2143.035">riding</rs>, and a <rs ref="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</rs> string, (tali <rs ref="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</rs>). They all played the <rs type="plant">bamboo</rs> drums. <persName>Bongso</persName> did the singing. The <rs ref="g:GEE2143.036">ruwai</rs> string became a path to the sky and the moon climbed up it. The next night they saw her back in her usual place,</p>
      <p>After some the time the moon gave birth to a child. This was <persName>Bongso</persName>'s child. <shift feature="epimyth"/>One of the stars is the child of the moon and <persName>Bongso</persName>.</p>
