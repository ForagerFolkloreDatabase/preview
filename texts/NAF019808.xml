        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>There was a pygmy who saw the sun one day in the middle of the afternoon. He thought it was a <rs type="animal">pig</rs>-skin, so of course he tried to chase it and catch it. The pygmy kept following but the sun would not stay still. Still the pygmy followed until the sun disappeared from sight and night arrived. The pygmy couldn't understand what had happened to the <rs type="animal">pig</rs>-skin. He went to sleep. When dawn came the sun was way off in another direction. The pygmy woke up and said to himself, "How did the pig-skin get way over there?" He went towards the east and the sun kept coming towards him. They got nearer and nearer and nearer ... then suddenly the sun passed <pb n="48"/>the pygmy. The pygmy said, "Now how did I pass the <rs type="animal">pig</rs>-skin?" and he turned and chased the sun. He walked to the west. He walked and walked and walked until the sun disappeared from sight and night arrived. The pygmy couldn't understand what had happened to the <rs type="animal">pig</rs>-skin. He went to sleep. <shift feature="epimyth"/>Basi ['That is all'].</p>
