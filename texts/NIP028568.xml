        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p><animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</ref></animal> the <animal>lizard</animal> was tired of lying in the sun, doing nothing. So he said, "I will go and play." He took his boomerangs out, and began to practise throwing them. While he was doing so a <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</ref></animal> came up, and stood near, watching the boomerangs come flying back, for the kind of <ref target="g:GIP0247.016">boomerangs</ref> <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</ref></animal> was throwing were the <ref target="g:GIP0247.023">bubberahs</ref>. <apartmyth>They are smaller than others, and more curved, and when they are properly thrown they return to the thrower, which other <ref target="g:GIP0247.016">boomerangs</ref> do not.</apartmyth></p>
      <p><animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</ref></animal> was proud of having the gay <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</ref></animal> to watch his skill. In his pride he gave the <ref target="g:GIP0247.023">bubberah</ref> an extra twist, and threw it with all his might. Whizz, whizzing through the air, back it came, hitting, as it passed her, the <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</ref></animal> on the top of her head, taking both feathers and skin clean off. The <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</ref></animal> set up a hideous, cawing, croaking shriek, and flew about, stopping every few minutes to knock her head on the ground like a mad <animal>bird</animal>. <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</ref></animal> was so frightened when he saw what he had done, and noticed that the blood was flowing from the <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</ref></animal>'s head, that he glided away to hide under a <plant><ref target="g:GIP0247.009">bindeah</ref> bush</plant>. But the <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</ref></animal> saw him. She never stopped the hideous noise she was making for a <pb n="7"/>minute, but, still shrieking, followed <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</ref></animal>. When she reached the <plant><ref target="g:GIP0247.009">bindeah</ref> bush</plant> she rushed at <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</ref></animal>, seized him with her beak, rolled him on the <plant>bush</plant> until every <ref target="g:GIP0247.009">bindeah</ref> had made a hole in his skin. Then she rubbed his skin with her own bleeding head. "Now then," she said, "you <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</ref></animal> shall carry <ref target="g:GIP0247.009">bindeahs</ref> on you always, and the stain of my blood."</p>
      <p>"And you," said <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</ref></animal>, as he hissed with pain from the tingling of the prickles, "shall be a bald-headed <animal>bird</animal> as long as I am a <color>red</color> prickly <animal>lizard</animal>."</p>
      <p>
        <epimyth>So to this day, underneath the <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</ref></animal>'s crest you can always find the bald patch which the <ref target="g:GIP0247.023">bubberah</ref> of <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</ref></animal> first made. And in the country of the <animal><ref target="g:GIP0247.058">Galahs</ref></animal> are <animal>lizards</animal> coloured <color>reddish</color> <color>brown</color>, and covered with spikes like <ref target="g:GIP0247.009">bindeah</ref> prickles.</epimyth>
