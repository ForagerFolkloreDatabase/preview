        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p><rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</rs> the <rs type="animal">lizard</rs> was tired of lying in the sun, doing nothing. So he said, "I will go and play." He took his boomerangs out, and began to practise throwing them. While he was doing so a <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</rs> came up, and stood near, watching the boomerangs come flying back, for the kind of <rs ref="g:GIP0247.016">boomerangs</rs> <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</rs> was throwing were the <rs ref="g:GIP0247.023">bubberahs</rs>. <shift feature="apartmyth"/>They are smaller than others, and more curved, and when they are properly thrown they return to the thrower, which other <rs ref="g:GIP0247.016">boomerangs</rs> do not.</p>
      <p><shift feature="diegesis"/><rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</rs> was proud of having the gay <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</rs> to watch his skill. In his pride he gave the <rs ref="g:GIP0247.023">bubberah</rs> an extra twist, and threw it with all his might. Whizz, whizzing through the air, back it came, hitting, as it passed her, the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</rs> on the top of her head, taking both feathers and skin clean off. The <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</rs> set up a hideous, cawing, croaking shriek, and flew about, stopping every few minutes to knock her head on the ground like a mad <rs type="animal">bird</rs>. <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</rs> was so frightened when he saw what he had done, and noticed that the blood was flowing from the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</rs>'s head, that he glided away to hide under a <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.009">bindeah bush</rs>. But the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</rs> saw him. She never stopped the hideous noise she was making for a <pb n="7"/>minute, but, still shrieking, followed <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</rs>. When she reached the <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.009">bindeah bush</rs> she rushed at <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</rs>, seized him with her beak, rolled him on the <rs type="plant">bush</rs> until every <rs ref="g:GIP0247.009">bindeah</rs> had made a hole in his skin. Then she rubbed his skin with her own bleeding head. "Now then," she said, "you <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</rs> shall carry <rs ref="g:GIP0247.009">bindeahs</rs> on you always, and the stain of my blood."</p>
      <p>"And you," said <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</rs>, as he hissed with pain from the tingling of the prickles, "shall be a bald-headed <rs type="animal">bird</rs> as long as I am a <rs type="color">red</rs> prickly <rs type="animal">lizard</rs>."</p>
      <p><shift feature="epimyth"/>So to this day, underneath the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.058">Galah</rs>'s crest you can always find the bald patch which the <rs ref="g:GIP0247.023">bubberah</rs> of <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.112">Oolah</rs> first made. And in the country of the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.058">Galahs</rs> are <rs type="animal">lizards</rs> coloured <rs type="color">reddish</rs> <rs type="color">brown</rs>, and covered with spikes like <rs ref="g:GIP0247.009">bindeah</rs> prickles.</p>
