        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>The Creator<note>The Creator was part of traditional mythology, presented here with a relative clause "who was there". I suggest that this relative clause is not here for identifcation purposes (as if it were a restrictive relative clause) nor even for parenthetical information (as if it were a nonrestrictive relative clause, of which there are no good examples in Seri - I believe that they do not exist), but for discourse purposes, to simply give some importance to this character in the story by slowing down the delivery of information.</note> had given antlers to the <rs type="animal" key="Sylvilagus sp." ref="q:Q40698246">cotton-tail rabbit</rs>, it is said<note>The use of yoque ('it is said') is typical in presentations of legends and certain other material that has been handed down from preceding generations (which may be historical in nature).</note>. Now, while they were quite like <rs type="animal">mule deer</rs> antlers, they were the right size for a <rs type="animal">cotton-tail</rs>. But a <rs type="animal">cotton-tail</rs> typically scurries under a <rs type="plant">bush</rs> when it is running away from something. And so it happened that the <rs type="animal">cotton-tail</rs> did that, and his antlers were snagged in the branches, throwing him on his back, it is said. So while he had been given antlers, they didn't suit him very well, and as a result the Creator removed them, they say.</p>
