        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>A long time ago there were no Malays or Chinese in Malaya. There were only jungle people (<rs ref="g:GEE2143.008">bi</rs> <rs ref="g:GEE2143.014">brete</rs>). Then a young Malay <rs ref="g:GEE2143.033">raja</rs><note>Raja (from the Sanskrit) is a Malay title used for prince, king, or ruler. The Chewong do not have such offices.</note> arrived on his own. He met Batin<note>Batin is the title given to aboriginal headmen elected by the Department for Aboriginal Affairs. It is also an old Malay title, applied to Malay chiefs of the south of the peninsula (Blagden 1906: II 557).</note> <persName>Tasimpaey</persName> and married his daughter. Later, lots of Malays arrived in many ships. They were looking for the <rs ref="g:GEE2143.033">raja</rs>. They looked around and saw that it was a beautiful place and they wanted to live there. They demanded Malaya for themselves. Batin Kòkn<note><rs ref="g:GEE2143.022">Kòkn</rs> is the Chewong word for woman. This myth demonstrates the fact that women may be <rs ref="g:GEE2143.032">putao</rs> and become spokesmen for the rest.</note> who was a woman and a great <rs ref="g:GEE2143.032">putao</rs>, would not give the land to the Malays. She said they would have a test. She and a Malay would both plant a <rs type="plant">sapling</rs> and if that planted by the Malay was still alive the following morning, the Malays would be allowed to enter. They both planted. The next morning the Malay's <rs type="plant">plant</rs> had died, whereas that of Batin Kòkn was alive. It had grown during the night into a tall <rs type="plant">tree</rs> with many <rs type="plant">flowers</rs>. Seeing this the Malays went away. Later they returned in three thousand ships and they had guns. The jungle people became very frightened and they ran away into the jungle where they have lived ever since.</p>
