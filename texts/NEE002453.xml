        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>One morning, the son of the Old Woman of the East<note>The "Old Woman of the East" is a spirit dwelling at the east end of the sky. She sends the dreadful east wind, which allegedly brings death.</note> said to his mother, "Mother, you seem to be in a good temper today, I will go out without clothes." "Don't go," said the mother, "my temper is short, but the day is long. I do not yet know what kind of mood I will be in. Put on some clothes!" "No," said her son, "you look as if you are in good spirits today," and went off without clothing. In the evening, after sundown, a frost settled, and the son froze to death. The mother was upset that her son had not taken any clothes with him.</p>
