        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals,
                    the evolutionary origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from an informant who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p><persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> was sitting in his house when his attendant came and said, "Don't sit here in the house, for somebody is coming to the beach here." - "Maybe this is what I am expecting, that will make things right on the beach." Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> went out of his house to invite <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName>. Then [<persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName>] entered the house of <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName>, and he was given dried [<animal>salmon</animal> to eat. It was dried] meat of the double-headed <animal>serpent</animal>. <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> began to eat it, and his body became contorted. Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> spoke. "Don't urge our friend here [to eat]." Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> and <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> went out of the house. <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> looked at his salmon-weir. Then <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> transformed him into stone. <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> became a man again, because he also had supernatural power. [He said,] "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will also do something to you." Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> transformed his friend into stone, but <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> became a man again.</p>
      <p>Then he warned <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName>. "Take warning, friend! Now I will try you again." They took hold of each other, and <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> held <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> by his sides. He lifted him up. Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> was transformed into fog. He became a man again. Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> spoke. "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will do something to you also." Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> lifted <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> and threw him upward. Then <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> also became fog. <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> became a man again.</p>
      <p><pb n="5"/>Then <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> spoke. "Go on, take warning, friend! Now I will try to lift you from the rock." Then <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> took hold of <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> and threw him upward. He transformed <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> into a <animal>crane</animal>, and the <animal>crane</animal> began to fly. <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> became a man again. Then he also warned <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName>. "Go on, take care, friend!" Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> took hold of <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> and threw him upward. A <animal>crane</animal> was flying there. <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> became a man again.</p>
      <p>Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> spoke. "Oh, indeed, you have supernatural power, friend! Come, let us go to my playground." Then they went aboard his canoe, and they paddled, going to <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName>'s play-round. They were dressed quite with the same kind of belts; namely, double-headed <animal>serpents</animal>. Double-headed <animal>serpents</animal> also were their canoes. Then they arrived at the playground.</p>
      <p>Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> spoke. "Take care, friend! else you might have a mishap on my playground. Nobody who ever tried to come and play on it has succeeded a single time. This is what makes it slippery, the blood of those who came from time to time to play here." Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> spoke. "You go on first, friend!" Thus <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> was told by his friend. "[No,] you first," said <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName>. "You said that it is your playground." - "Let me go first, friend," said <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName>, on his part. Then he [<persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName>] clapped on the gunwale of his canoe with his paddle, and <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> ran up. <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> ran straight up. He did not rest on his resting-place halfway up: he just turned round and came down again and jumped into his canoe.</p>
      <p>Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> spoke. "Now you go, friend!" Thus he said to <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName>. "Take care, fasten your belt well, else it might [drag] behind you!" Then <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> ran. He had nearly reached the top when he <pb n="7"/>slipped on the rock. His belt came off, and <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> fell down. He fell into the water and sank. Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> went away to <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName>'s canoe, and upset it on the water. "Indeed, you have no real supernatural power, friend," thus he said while upsetting <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName>'s canoe.</p>
      <p><persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> waited in vain for <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> to show himself, but <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> just did mischief to <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName>'s land. <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> transformed into stone a <animal>beaver</animal> that was sitting by the river. Then <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> caught sight of the watchman at the salmon-weir of <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName>. He transformed into stone him and his pole. Then he also transformed into stone the watchman of <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName>. Then <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> was vanquished by <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName>, for <persName>Xat&#275;&#700;ts&#7431;n</persName> did not know what <persName>Q!&#257;&#700;n&#275;q&#275;&#7499;lak&#7512;</persName> was doing.</p>
