        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>A man was blessed with a sister and mother, but unfortunately was without good sense, and for this reason he was known as <persName>Wabassi</persName> [lit., a sickly person]. His sister had a <rs type="animal">dog</rs> called <persName>Warribisi</persName> [lit., a <rs type="animal">wasp</rs>]. One day <persName>Wabassi</persName> went down to the seashore to catch big <rs type="animal">bunari crabs</rs>, and just as he was about to step out of the boat, an immense <rs type="animal">tiger</rs> approached; thinking it was his sister's <rs type="animal">dog</rs>, he exclaimed: "<persName>Warribisi</persName>! <persName>Warribisi</persName>! Come on! What are you doing here?" And as the <rs type="animal">creature</rs> trotted up quite close, he seized it round the waist, and tried to pull it into the boat. Of course the <rs type="animal">tiger</rs> growled, but all <persName>Wabassi</persName> said was, "Don't bite me, <persName>Warribisi</persName>," and as the <rs type="animal">animal</rs> was too heavy and clumsy to be dragged in, he lost his temper and said: "Stupid <persName>Warribisi</persName>. Stay where you are, then, and may <rs type="animal">Tiger</rs> come and eat you!" When <persName>Wabassi</persName> got home, he told his sister that he had seen her <rs type="animal">dog</rs>. She said: "No, you did not. You cannot be in your right senses. <persName>Warribisi</persName> has been here with me all the time." On another occasion <persName>Wabassi</persName> joined some friends and relatives on a hunting expedition: they came across a herd of <rs type="animal">bush-hog</rs>, and <persName>Wabassi</persName> shot one. By and by, his friends collected into one big heap all the <rs type="animal">hogs</rs> that they had shot, and <persName>Wabassi</persName> came to have a look at their spoil, leaving his own <rs type="animal">quarry</rs> behind. "Oh!" said he, "my <rs type="animal">bush-hog</rs> is different from these. Mine has a mark on his head, and a flat nose." So the other hunters told him to go and fetch it and let them have a look. When they saw it, they were much surprised to recognize a <rs type="animal">tiger</rs>, and still more so to learn that his captor had not even met with a scratch. Next day after they reached home. <persName>Wabassi</persName> dressed himself like a <rs type="animal">bird</rs>, with a feather [representing the tail] stuck into his belt behind; he climbed a high <rs type="plant">tree</rs> and jumped from limb to limb three times; on the fourth occasion he alighted on a dry limb, which broke, and he fell to earth. "How splendidly I can fly!" he remarked, when he picked himself up.</p>
