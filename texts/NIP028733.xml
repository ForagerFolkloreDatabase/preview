        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary

        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p><rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs> was a very old woman, and a very wicked old woman too, as this story will tell. During all the past season, when the <rs type="plant">grass</rs> was thick with seed, she had gathered much <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.049">doonburr</rs>, which she crushed into meal as she wanted it for food. She used to crush it on a big flat stone with small flat stones - the big stone was called a <rs ref="g:GIP0247.043">dayoorl</rs>. <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs> ground a great deal of the <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.049">doonburr</rs> seed to put away for immediate use, the rest she kept whole, to be ground as required.</p>
      <p>Soon after she had finished her first grinding, a neighbouring tribe came along and camped near where she was. One day the men all went out hunting, leaving the women and the children in the camp. After the men had been gone a little while, <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs> the <rs type="animal">magpie</rs> came to their camp to talk to the women. She said, "Why do you not go hunting too? Many are the nests of the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.132">wurranunnahs</rs> round here, and thick is the honey in them. Many and ripe are the bumbles hanging now on the <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.027">bumble trees</rs>; <rs type="color">red</rs> is the fruit of the <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.076">grooees</rs>, and opening with ripeness <pb n="16"/>the fruit of the <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.079">guiebets</rs>. Yet you sit in the camp and hunger, until your husbands return with the <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.047">dinewan</rs> and <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.021">bowrah</rs> they have gone forth to slay. Go, women, and gather of the plenty that surrounds you. I will take care of your children, the little <rs ref="g:GIP0247.120">Wahroogahs</rs>."</p>
      <p>"Your words are wise," the women said. "It is foolish to sit here and hunger, when near at hand <rs type="plant">yams</rs> are thick in the ground, and many fruits wait but the plucking. We will go and fill quickly our <rs ref="g:GIP0247.033">comebees</rs> and goolays, but our children we will take with us."</p>
      <p>"Not so," said <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs>, "foolish indeed were you to do that. You would tire the little feet of those that run, and tire yourselves with the burden of those that have to be carried. No, take forth your <rs ref="g:GIP0247.033">comebees</rs> and goolays empty, that ye may bring back the more. Many are the spoils that wait only the hand of the gatherer. Look ye, I have a <rs ref="g:GIP0247.054">durrie</rs> made of fresh <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.049">doonburr</rs> seed, cooking just now on that bark between two fires; that shall your children eat, and swiftly shall I make them another. They shall eat and be full ere their mothers are out of sight. See, they come to me now, they hunger for <rs ref="g:GIP0247.054">durrie</rs>, and well will I feed them. Haste ye then, that ye may return in time to make ready the fires for cooking the meat your husbands will bring. Glad will your husbands be when they see that ye have filled your goolays and <rs ref="g:GIP0247.033">comebees</rs> with fruits, and your <rs ref="g:GIP0247.128">wirrees</rs> with honey. Haste ye, I say, and do well."</p>
      <p>Having listened to the words of <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs>, the women decided to do as she said, and, leaving their children with her, they started forth with empty <rs ref="g:GIP0247.033">comebees</rs>, and armed with <rs ref="g:GIP0247.034">combos</rs>, with which to chop out the <rs type="animal">bees</rs>' nests and <rs type="animal">opossums</rs>, and with yam sticks to dig up <rs type="plant">yams</rs>.</p>
      <p>When the women had gone, <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs> gathered the children round her and fed them with <rs ref="g:GIP0247.054">durrie</rs>, hot from the coals. Honey, too, she gave them, and <rs type="plant" ref="g:GIP0247.027">bumbles</rs> which she had buried to ripen. When they had eaten, she hurried them off to her real home, built in a hollow <rs type="plant">tree</rs>, a little distance away from where she had been cooking her <rs ref="g:GIP0247.054">durrie</rs>. Into her house she hurriedly thrust them, followed quickly herself, and made all secure. Here she fed them again, but the children had already satisfied their hunger, and now they missed their mothers and began to cry. Their crying reached the ears of the women as they were returning to their camp. Quickly they came at the sound which is not good in a mother's ears. As they quickened their steps they thought how soon the spoils that lay heavy in their <rs ref="g:GIP0247.033">comebees</rs> would comfort their children. And happy they, the mothers, would feel when they fed the <rs ref="g:GIP0247.120">Wahroogahs</rs> with the dainties they had gathered for them. Soon they reached the camp, but, alas! where were their children? And where was <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs> the <rs type="animal">magpie</rs>?</p>
      <p>"They are playing <rs ref="g:GIP0247.119">wahgoo</rs>," they said, "and have hidden themselves."</p>
      <p>The mothers hunted all round for them, and called aloud the names of their children and <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs>. But no answer could they hear and no trace could they find. And yet every now and then they heard the sound of children wailing. But seek as they would they found them not. Then loudly wailed the mothers themselves for their lost <rs ref="g:GIP0247.120">Wahroogahs</rs>, and, wailing, returned to the camp to wait the coming of the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows. Heavy were their hearts, and sad were their faces when their husbands returned. They hastened to tell the <rs type="color">black</rs> fellows when they came, how <pb n="18"/><rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs> had persuaded them to go hunting, promising if they did so that she would feed the hungry <rs ref="g:GIP0247.120">Wahroogahs</rs>, and care for them while they were away, but - and here they wailed again for their poor <rs ref="g:GIP0247.120">Wahroogahs</rs>. They told how they had listened to her words and gone; truth had she told of the plenty round, their <rs ref="g:GIP0247.033">comebees</rs> and goolays were full of fruits and spoils they had gathered, but, alas! they came home with them laden only to find their children gone and <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs> gone too. And no trace could they find of either, though at times they heard a sound as of children wailing.</p>
      <p>Then wroth were the men, saying: "What mothers are ye to leave your young to a stranger, and that stranger a <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs>, ever a treacherous race? Did we not go forth to gain food for you and our children? Saw ye ever your husbands return from the chase empty handed? Then why, when ye knew we were gone hunting, must ye too go forth and leave our helpless ones to a stranger? Oh, evil, evil indeed is the time that has come when a mother forgets her child. Stay ye in the camp while we go forth to hunt for our lost <rs ref="g:GIP0247.120">Wahroogahs</rs>. Heavy will be our hands on the women if we return without them."</p>
      <p>The men hunted the <rs type="plant">bush</rs> round for miles, but found no trace of the lost <rs ref="g:GIP0247.120">Wahroogahs</rs>, though they too heard at times a noise as of children's voices wailing.</p>
      <p>But beyond the wailing which echoed in the mothers' ears for ever, no trace was found of the children. For many days the women sat in the camp mourning for their lost <rs ref="g:GIP0247.120">Wahroogahs</rs>, and beating their heads because they had listened to the voice of <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.069">Gooloo</rs>.</p>
