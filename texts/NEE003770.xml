        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>Once a Samoyed of the Lyamin river directed his boat toward a rise on the shore to fell <rs type="plant" key="Rhamnus frangula">buckthorn trees (Rhamnus frangula)</rs> there for a fish trap. After working he sat down by his boat and lit his pipe. Then he saw a three-eyed raven-like <rs type="animal">bird</rs> settle onto the rise and vanish. After some time he looked towards the mountain again where now stood a humanoid being; when it turned its back to the Samoyed, he saw that there was a face on the back of the head as well. It lay down on its belly and slid down the mountain to the middle of the river and then went back to the mountain without sinking into the water. On the second try it almost slid to the other side of the river. The Samoyed was frightened, trembled by his boat and prayed to <persName>Num</persName> that <persName>Parnyy</persName> would not do anything bad to him. When he returned home, he sacrificed a <rs type="animal">reindeer</rs> to <persName>Num</persName>. Since then, no one fells <rs type="plant">trees</rs> on that mountain.</p>
