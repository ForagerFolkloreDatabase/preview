        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary

      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p><rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs> and <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.071">Goomai</rs>, the <rs type="animal">water rat</rs>, were down at the creek one day, getting <rs type="animal">mussels</rs> for food, when, to their astonishment, a <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs> hopped right into the water beside them. Well they knew that he must be escaping from hunters, who were probably pressing him close. So <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs> quickly seized her yam stick, and knocked the <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs> on the head; he was caught fast in the <rs type="plant">weeds</rs> in the creek, so could not escape. When the two old women had killed the <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs> they hid its body under the <rs type="plant">weeds</rs> in the creek, fearing to take it out and cook it straight away, lest the hunters should come up and claim it. The little son of <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs> watched them from the bank. After having hidden the <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>, the women picked up their <rs type="animal">mussels</rs> and started for their camp, when up came the hunters, <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.116">Quarrian</rs> and <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.060">Gidgereegah</rs>, who had tracked the <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs> right to the creek.</p>
      <p>Seeing the women they said: "Did you see a <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>?"</p>
      <p>The women answered: "No. We saw no <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>."</p>
      <p>"That is strange, for we have tracked it right up to here."</p>
      <p><pb n="36"/>"We have seen no <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>. See, we have been digging out <rs type="animal">mussels</rs> for food. Come to our camp, and we will give you some when they are cooked."</p>
      <p>The young men, puzzled in their minds, followed the women to their camp, and when the <rs type="animal">mussels</rs> were cooked the hunters joined the old women at their dinner. The little boy would not eat the <rs type="animal">mussels</rs>; he kept crying to his mother, "<rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs>. I want <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>. I want <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>. <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs>. <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs>."</p>
      <p>"There," said <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.116">Quarrian</rs>. "Your little boy has seen the <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>, and wants some; it must be here somewhere."</p>
      <p>"Oh, no. He cries for anything he thinks of, some days for <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>; he is only a little boy, and does not know what he wants," said old <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs>. But still the child kept saying, "<rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs>. <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs>. I want <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>. I want <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>." <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.071">Goomai</rs> was so angry with little <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs> for keeping on asking for <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>, and thereby making the young men suspicious, that she hit him so hard on the mouth to keep him quiet, that the blood came, and trickled down his breast, staining it <rs type="color">red</rs>. When she saw this, old <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs> grew angry in her turn, and hit old <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.071">Goomai</rs>, who returned the blow, and so a fight began, more words than blows, so the noise was great, the women fighting, little <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs> crying, not quite knowing whether he was crying because <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.071">Goomai</rs> had hit him, because his mother was fighting, or because he still wanted <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>.</p>
      <p><rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.116">Quarrian</rs> said to <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.060">Gidgereegah</rs>: "They have the <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs> somewhere hidden; let us slip away now in the confusion. We will only hide, then come back in a little while, and surprise them."</p>
      <p><pb n="37"/>They went quietly away, and as soon as the two women noticed they had gone, they ceased fighting, and determined to cook the <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>. They watched the two young men out of sight, and waited some time so as to be sure that they were safe. Then down they hurried to get the <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs>. They dragged it out, and were just making a big fire on which to cook it, when up came <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.116">Quarrian</rs> and <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.060">Gidgereegah</rs>, saying:</p>
      <p>"Ah! we thought so. You had our <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs> all the time; little <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs> was right."</p>
      <p>"But we killed it," said the women.</p>
      <p>"But we hunted it here," said the men, and so saying caught hold of the <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs> and dragged it away to some distance, where they made a fire and cooked it. <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.071">Goomai</rs>, <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs>, and her little boy went over to <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.116">Quarrian</rs> and <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.060">Gidgereegah</rs>, and begged for some of the meat, but the young men would give them none, though little <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs> cried piteously for some. But no; they said they would rather throw what they did not want to the <rs type="animal">hawks</rs> than give it to the women or child. At last, seeing that there was no hope of their getting any, the women went away. They built a big <rs ref="g:GIP0247.041">dardurr</rs> for themselves, shutting themselves and the little boy up in it. Then they began singing a song which was to invoke a storm to destroy their enemies, for so now they considered <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.116">Quarrian</rs> and <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.060">Gidgereegah</rs>. For some time they chanted:</p>
      <lg type="song">
        <l>"<rs ref="g:GIP0247.095">Moogaray</rs>, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.095">Moogaray</rs>, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.089">May</rs>, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.089">May</rs>, </l>
        <l><rs ref="g:GIP4128.054">Eehu</rs>, <rs ref="g:GIP4128.054">Eehu</rs>, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.050">Doongarah</rs>." </l>
      </lg>
      <p>First they would begin very slowly and softly, gradually getting quicker and louder, until at length they almost <pb n="38"/>shrieked it out. The words they said meant, "Come hailstones; come wind; come rain; come lightning."</p>
      <p>While they were chanting, little <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs> kept crying, and would not be comforted. Soon came a few big drops of rain, then a big wind, and as that lulled, more rain. Then came thunder and lightning, the air grew bitterly cold, and there came a pitiless hailstorm, hailstones bigger than a <rs type="animal">duck</rs>'s egg fell, cutting the leaves from the <rs type="plant">trees</rs> and bruising their bark. <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.060">Gidgereegah</rs> and <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.116">Quarrian</rs> came running over to the <rs ref="g:GIP0247.041">dardurr</rs> and begged the women to let them in.</p>
      <p>"No," shrieked <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.081">Gwineeboo</rs> above the storm, "there was no kangaroo meat for us: there is no <rs ref="g:GIP0247.041">dardurr</rs> shelter for you. Ask shelter of the <rs type="animal">hawks</rs> whom ye fed." The men begged to be let in, said they would hunt again and get <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs> for the women, not one but many. "No," again shrieked the women. "You would not even listen to the crying of a little child; it is better such as you should perish." And fiercer raged the storm and louder sang the women:</p>
      <lg type="song">
        <l>"<rs ref="g:GIP0247.095">Moogaray</rs>, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.095">Moogaray</rs>, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.089">May</rs>, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.089">May</rs>, </l>
        <l><rs ref="g:GIP4128.054">Eehu</rs>, <rs ref="g:GIP4128.054">Eehu</rs>, <rs ref="g:GIP0247.050">Doongarah</rs>." </l>
      </lg>
      <p>So long and so fierce was the storm that the young men <pb n="39"/>must have perished had they not been changed into <rs type="animal">birds</rs>. First they were changed into <rs type="animal">birds</rs> and afterwards into stars in the sky, <shift feature="epimyth"/>where they now are, <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.060">Gidgereegah</rs> and <rs type="animal" ref="g:GIP0247.116">Quarrian</rs> with the <rs type="animal">kangaroo</rs> between them, still bearing the names that they bore on the earth.</p>
