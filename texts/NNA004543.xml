        <p>Text digitized and encoded for use in the Forager Folklore Database. The FFDB
                    offers a basis for a systematic study of narrative universals, the evolutionary 
                    origin of storytelling, and (comparative) folklore studies.</p>
      </projectDesc>
      <samplingDecl>
        <p>The narrative was selected for being a genuine piece of oral literature recorded
                    directly, or mediated by an interpreter, from a narrator who either lived or
                    grew up as a member of a culture whose subsistence at the time of recording was,
                    or until recently had been, depending primarily on hunting, gathering, and/or
                    fishing. Care was taken to ensure the quality of the recording and the relative
                    absence of external cultural influences.</p>

      <p>The <rs type="animal" key="Hippocampus ingens" ref="q:Q2328113">seahorse</rs> was there [as a person, on the Earth], along with <rs type="plant" key="Cylindropuntia bigelovii" ref="q:Q148519">teddybear cholla cactus</rs>, the <rs type="plant" key="Cylindropuntia fulgida" ref="q:Q149599">cholla cactus</rs> skeleton, the <rs type="plant" key="Cylindropuntia arbuscula">pencil cholla</rs>, the <rs type="plant" key="Pachycereus pringlei" ref="q:Q285324">cardon cactus</rs>, and the <rs type="plant" key="Carnegiea gigantea" ref="q:Q275573">saguaro cactus</rs>. The <rs type="animal">seahorse</rs> was a person and was running in the countryside while the others were shooting arrows at him. He was responding in kind by throwing rocks. He was coming close to <placeName>Tecomate</placeName>, near the place [now] called <placeName>'Where Seahorse Evaded'</placeName>. He was taking evasive action and moving around, and for that reason the stones there look like they've been piled up. He kept running, and then went through the area around <placeName>'Big Crucillo Bush Bay'</placeName> and arrived at the beach. As he was about to enter the sea, he removed his sandals, putting them behind him [under the cord holding up his waistcloth]. Then he fastened his braids - it's called the Seri man's braid yarn - it was here on his head. When a man was about to do something that required quick action, he would put his hair in braids, and fasten it so.<note>The narrator was apparently indicating the top of his head at this point.</note> The knot is still here [on the back of the head of the <rs type="animal">seahorse</rs>]. His sandals are here [referring to that place on the <rs type="animal">seahorse</rs>].</p>
      <p>And so he went down into the sea, and that is why he became what is called the <rs type="animal">seahorse</rs>. The <rs type="plant">cholla cactus</rs> is full of holes, and the <rs type="plant">cardon cactus</rs> ribs are not close together, evidence of where they [rocks, etc.] hit and glanced off them, they say. That's how it is. The [<rs type="animal">seahorse</rs>] was a true ancestor. He was a person when he was doing this.</p>
      <p>The <rs type="plant">cardon</rs> and the <rs type="plant" key="Stenocereus thurberi" ref="q:Q1975128">organ pipe cactus</rs>, all of them were Seris. The <rs type="plant" key="Lophocereus schottii" ref="q:Q15320987">senita cactus</rs> was not a person. Well, he was a person, but he wasn't a real person. He had something to do with the Catastrophe. The <rs type="plant">senita cactus</rs> was the first of the <rs type="plant">plants</rs> to be created - before the <rs type="plant">cardon</rs> and before the <rs type="plant">saguaro</rs>. He was caught in the big wave that happened during the Catastrophe. He was with the <rs type="plant">ironwood tree</rs> at that time. <shift feature="epimyth"/>That's how it was. It's widely known. And that's it.</p>
